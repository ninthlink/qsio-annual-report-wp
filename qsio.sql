In a recent interview with WP Tavern, Matt Mullenweg confirmed that the o2 development team is <a href="http://wptavern.com/o2-development-team-shifts-focus-to-wordpress-coms-core-products" target="_blank">shifting its focus to WordPress.com&#8217;s core products</a> but that the o2 code would be public for anyone to use.</p>\n<p>o2 was is the successor to <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/p2/" target="_blank">P2</a>, the innovative group blogging theme created to power communications at Automattic. P2 was <a href="http://wptavern.com/p2-officially-on-the-theme-repository" target="_blank">released in 2009</a> with the tagline &#8220;Blogging at the speed of thought.&#8221; It introduced quick posting from the front page and real-time updates.</p>\n<p>o2 shares P2&#8217;s tagline but, unlike its predecessor, it was created to be a plugin that is not dependent on a specific theme.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/devinsays">@devinsays</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelarestad">@michaelarestad</a> that''s the theory!</p>\n<p>&mdash; Kevin Conboy (@alternatekev) <a href="https://twitter.com/alternatekev/status/610413606446825473">June 15, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s not guaranteed to work with any theme, so if you want the best experience you should test it out with the <a href="https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe" target="_blank">p2-breathe theme</a>, as recommended in the GitHub installation instructions. o2 requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/genericond/" target="_blank">Genericon&#8217;d</a> plugin and if you want the ability to insert code blocks, it requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/" target="_blank">SyntaxHighlighter Evolved</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>The readme.txt on GitHub cautions that &#8220;multisite self-hosted installs have not yet been tested and may not work.&#8221; Although the plugin was written to shine within a network environment with cross-site search and cross-site posting, the network features are not guaranteed to work for self-hosted users. However, the improved real-time commenting, drag-and-drop media upload, and other enhancements may make using O2 worthwhile on single site WordPress installations.</p>\n<p>A cursory look at the issues queue indicates that some of the features that work on WordPress.com may still be buggy for self-hosted installations, such as <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/o2/issues/3" target="_blank">@mentions in posts in comments</a>. The good news for those who were eagerly awaiting o2&#8217;s release is that the code, while not completely polished and bug-free, is now <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/o2" target="_blank">public on GitHub</a>. Even though Automattic is shifting its focus away from the project, anyone who wants to help improve it can submit a pull request or fork o2 for their own use.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 17:30:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"Matt: Priceless Words";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45151";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/priceless-words/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:405:"<blockquote><p>“It&#8217;s easy to be very busy but not get anything done that you&#8217;ll look back a year from now and say was worthwhile.”</p>\n<p>“You&#8217;ll get a lot of contradictory advice, and often neither side is wrong.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Entrepreneur.com <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246745">collected a few quotes from me and blogged some context for each</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 01:25:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"Matt: How Tesla Will Change The World";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45149";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-the-world/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:149:"<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html">How Tesla Will Change The World</a> from the great Wait But Why.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 13 Jun 2015 23:25:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Matt: Munchery Eating the World";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45143";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/munchery-eating-the-world/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:380:"<p>Shervin has an amazing write-up on <a href="https://medium.com/@shervin/how-munchery-is-literally-eating-the-world-218c6520dc99">how Munchery is literally eating the world</a>, and Sherpa&#8217;s continuing investment there.

Okay, fine. Here are my favorite parts:</p>\n<h3>Where is code?</h3>\n<p>While the entire article answers, &#8220;What is code?&#8221;, he starts by answering, &#8220;Where is code?&#8221; Code is much broader than the web. It&#8217;s pervasive. Everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most programmers aren’t working on building a widely recognized application like Microsoft Word. Software is everywhere. It’s gone from a craft of fragile, built-from-scratch custom projects to an industry of standardized parts, where coders absorb and improve upon the labors of their forebears (even if those forebears are one cubicle over). Software is there when you switch channels and your cable box shows you what else is on. You get money from an ATM—software. An elevator takes you up five stories—the same. Facebook releases software every day to something like a billion people, and that software runs inside Web browsers and mobile applications. Facebook looks like it’s just pictures of your mom’s crocuses or your son’s school play—but no, it’s software.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Computers are dumb</h3>\n<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">Until they&#8217;re not</a>. But today, computers really don&#8217;t know anything; they return things based on what we put in them, and they can do so many things faster than we can.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every character truly, truly matters. Every single stupid misplaced semicolon, space where you meant tab, bracket instead of a parenthesis—mistakes can leave the computer in a state of panic. The trees don’t know where to put their leaves. Their roots decay. The boxes don’t stack neatly. For not only are computers as dumb as a billion marbles, they’re also positively Stradivarian in their delicacy.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Programming languages</h3>\n<p>Paul spends a ton of time talking about various programming languages, their origins, their styles, their adoptions, their usefulness, and how they&#8217;ve evolved.</p>\n<p>He primarily focuses on C (and how it&#8217;s fast but not object oriented) and Java (and how it&#8217;s object oriented but not fast, relatively). Amazingly, he manages to talk about many, many languages, their attributes, and yet explain them in a way that nearly anyone can understand.</p>\n<p>I have to admit something: I am so far from a classically trained developer that I found this focus of the article to be incredibly educational. I learned the wrong way, from the tip of the pyramid down. If you consider markup and styles the very tip, and then WordPress is a bit below that as a framework for PHP &#8212; and you are still only part way down the pyramid. PHP is built with C and C compiles to machine code. His article helped me understand the pyramid from the other direction much better.</p>\n<h3>Programmer culture</h3>\n<p>An important piece of the article was around culture. He spends time both on programmer attitudes and broader programming culture, such as conferences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Languages have agendas. People glom onto them. Blunt talk is seen as a good quality in a developer, a sign of an “engineering mindset”—spit out every opinion as quickly as possible, the sooner to reach a technical consensus. Expect to be told you’re wrong; expect to tell other people they’re wrong. (Masculine anger, bluntly expressed, is part of the industry.)</p>\n<p>Coding is a culture of blurters. This can yield fast decisions, but it penalizes people who need to quietly compose their thoughts, rewarding fast-twitch thinkers who harrumph efficiently. Programmer job interviews, which often include abstract and meaningless questions that must be answered immediately on a whiteboard, typify this culture. Regular meetings can become sniping matches about things that don’t matter. The shorthand term for that is “bikeshedding.” (Who cares what color the bike shed is painted? Well …)</p>\n<p>Code culture is very, very broad, but the geographic and cultural core is the Silicon Valley engine of progress. The Valley mythologizes young geniuses with vast sums. To its credit, this culture works; to its shame, it doesn’t work for everyone.</p>\n<p>At any moment some new thing could catch fire and disrupt the tribal ebb and flow. Instagram was written in Python and sold for $2 billion, so Python had a moment of glory. The next mind-blowing app could show up, written in some new language—and start everyone taking that more seriously. Within 18 months your skills could be, if not quite valueless, suspect.</p>\n<p>I was in a meeting once where someone said, “How long will it take to fix that?” One person, who’d been at the company for years, said, “Three months.” A new person, who’d just come from a world of rapidly provisioned cloud microservices, said, “Three minutes.” They were both correct. That’s how change enters into this world. Slowly at first, then on the front page of Hacker News.</p>\n<p>Programmers carve out a sliver of cognitive territory for themselves and go to conferences, and yet they know their position is vulnerable. They get defensive when they hear someone suggest that Python is better than Ruby, because [insert 500-comment message thread here]. Is the next great wave swelling somewhere, and will it wash away Java when it comes? Will Go conquer Python? Do I need to learn JavaScript to remain profitable? Programmers are often angry because they’re often scared. We are, most of us, stumbling around with only a few candles to guide the way. We can’t always see the whole system, so we need to puzzle it out, bit by bit, in the dark.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And his passage on the decreasing percentages of female coders is pure perfection:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The average programmer is moderately diligent, capable of basic mathematics, has a working knowledge of one or more programming languages, and can communicate what he or she is doing to management and his or her peers. Given that a significant number of women work as journalists and editors, perform surgery, run companies, manage small businesses, and use spreadsheets, that a few even serve on the Supreme Court, and that we are no longer surprised to find women working as accountants, professors, statisticians, or project managers, it’s hard to imagine that they can’t write JavaScript. Programming, despite the hype and the self-serving fantasies of programmers the world over, isn’t the most intellectually demanding task imaginable.</p>\n<p>Which leads one to the inescapable conclusion: The problem with women in technology isn’t the women.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>PHP and (sorta) WordPress</h3>\n<p>Of everything discussed in the article, the one thing I really could tell he didn&#8217;t appreciate much was PHP.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can get a site up and running in PHP in a few minutes, and that’s the problem. It used to be the terrible choice you made when you needed to get something done on the Web, but increasingly JavaScript has replaced it as the default terrible choice.</p>\n<p>PHP stands for Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter. The idea was that when you loaded your Web pages, the PHP code would run before the page went out to the Internet. And PHP could, say, check whether you were logged in. If you were, it could show you your top secret account details; and if you weren’t, it could say, “Please log in.”</p>\n<p>I know a lot of people who program in PHP, and they are smart, good people. PHP powers Etsy and Facebook. It powers Wikipedia, for God’s sake. WordPress. Out of all the Web’s pages, an enormous percentage is created with PHP.</p>\n<p>Coding in PHP for a living is not a death sentence. Lots of people have gotten rich off PHP. It just means a lot of cutting and pasting, and a lot of trips to Google to figure out why things aren’t working.</p>\n<p>Poor, sad, misbegotten, incredibly effective, massively successful PHP. Reading PHP code is like reading poetry, the poetry you wrote freshman year of college.</p>\n<p>I spent so many hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours programming in PHP, back when I didn’t know what I was doing and neither did PHP. Reloading Web pages until my fingers were sore. (I can hear your sympathetic sobs.) Everything was always broken, and people were always hacking into my sites.</p>\n<p>PHP. I don’t wish it any harm. I’m glad to see how well it’s done for itself. We had some good times together. I just don’t ever want to go back there.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He also uses WordPress as the punching bag for the story in the story. The fictional story within the article is of a company that&#8217;s replacing their current website with a new website. It&#8217;s a big corporate environment and they&#8217;re, &#8220;at the limits with WordPress.&#8221; Of course, <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/06/paul-ford-what-is-code-bloomberg/">Matt Mullenweg took issue</a> with that one aspect on his own blog.</p>\n<h3>Debugging, testing, and version control</h3>\n<p>Paul gives some of the best layman&#8217;s descriptions for debugging, testing, and version control I&#8217;ve ever read. He closes the section with this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>See, tests and version control are now the trigger for actually shipping code. If you can follow a process like this, you can release software several times a day—which in the days of shrink-wrapped software would have been folly. (Often builds were done nightly, by big “build servers,” and one would come in the next morning to get the score.) But now that software can be released via the Web or an app store, why wait? Why not continually release software, every day, whenever you have something that’s ready to go?</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Actually picking a language</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to limit this one and it was one of my favorite parts, so I&#8217;m just going to toss it in in bulk.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Beware of arguments related to programming speed. All things being equal, faster is better. But all things are never equal. Do you need the kind of speed that lets you get a website up and running quickly? Or the kind that allows you to rotate a few thousand polygons in 3D in real time? Do you need to convert 10,000 PDFs into text per hour? Or 10 million PDFs into text once? These are different problems. What do we need to do, how many times do we need to do it, and what existing code can we use to help us do it that many times? Ask those questions.</p>\n<p>It’s possible to spend productive months preparing for a project without deciding on a language. It may be the sign of a fine manager, someone who assumes his people can learn new things, someone who’s built an agile team capable of experimenting with new technologies and getting ideas into production. It could also be that this person is totally useless. You’ll find out!</p>\n<p>Let’s say your programmers are developing a huge website that serves 5 million people who each visit five times a month. Do you use Python, which is slower, or Go, which is fast, or Node.js, which is something in-between? Trick question! Twenty-five million Web page visits isn’t that big a deal, unless they involve some deep wizardry or complex database queries that are very different for each page (good example: Facebook).</p>\n<p>Now, that number isn’t trivial; if it takes a minute to make a page, you’d need 48 years to make that many, which is way too slow. If it takes a second to make a page, that’s still too slow—there are only 2.6 million seconds in a month. So you need to figure out how to serve about 10 pages per second. You’ll probably want more than one computer, a little redundancy, some good server setup. It will take some doing and planning. But it can be done in any language.</p>\n<p>What if you are going to serve only a few hundred thousand pages a month? Then you’ve got tremendous breathing room. You don’t need too many engineers to create the system architecture. You still need to plan, but in general you can read some blog posts and follow along with what others have done. You can be pretty sloppy, to be honest. Again, any language will do.</p>\n<p>What if you want to include a live, person-to-person chat on those pages, and you expect thousands of people to use that chat at once, all speaking to each other? Now you’re dipping your hand into that godforsaken river. But that is exactly the problem that Go was designed to solve. It’s a language for creating highly available servers that use as much of the computer’s processor as possible. It has other features as well, but this is where Go shines. Actually, Node.js works pretty well for that sort of server, too, and Clojure certainly has the capacity. Oh, right, Java works, too. If you really needed to, you could even do it in PHP.</p>\n<p>This is why the choice is so hard. Everything can do everything, and people will tell you that you should use everything to do everything. So you need to figure out for yourself what kind of team you have, what kind of frameworks you like using, where people can be most productive, so they will stick around through the completion of the project. This is hard. Most places can’t do this. So they go with the lowest common denominator—Java, PHP—because they know that when people leave, they’ll be able to get more of them.</p>\n<p>And that’s OK. The vast majority of technology projects don’t require original research, nor do they require amazing technological discoveries. All the languages under discussion work just fine. There are great coders in all of them.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Should you learn to code?</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only highlighted some of my favorite parts.

While there are already hundreds of lightbox plugins available for WordPress, this one may prove to be the &#8220;lightest&#8221; of them all.</p>\n<p>The plugin is essentially a wrapper for the <a href="http://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/" target="_blank">Featherlight jQuery lightbox script</a> created by Noel Bossart. Featherlight.js was designed to be very lightweight and is just 400 lines of JavaScript, 100 of CSS, and less than 6kB combined. It works on IE8+, all modern browsers, and on mobile platforms. The script is responsive and supports images, ajax, and iframes out of the box.</p>\n<p>WP Featherlight solves a number of problems that WordPress users often encounter with lightbox plugins, many of which contain a load of heavy-handed styling that is difficult to override.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were having a really hard time finding a lightbox plugin that was simple to customize, but that was also lightweight, flexible, and didn’t add a bunch of bloat to our website,&#8221; WP Site Care founder Ryan Sullivan said in his <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/wp-featherlight/" target="_blank">post</a> introducing the plugin.</p>\n<p>The WP Site Care team opted to build their own solution on top of Featherlight.js. The resulting plugin provides a fast, minimalist style popup for images and galleries.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-featherlight-screenshot.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-featherlight-screenshot.png?resize=1025%2C786" alt="wp-featherlight-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45168" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin includes built-in support for native WordPress galleries and <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/tiled-galleries/" target="_blank">Jetpack galleries</a>. When you install it, there are no options to configure. It will automatically display all images and galleries in a lightbox. If you <a href="https://github.com/noelboss/featherlight/#usage" target="_blank">add some extra data attributes to your content</a>, it&#8217;s also possible to display videos, iframes, and ajax content with WP Featherlight.</p>\n<p>The demo video below shows how the plugin works with galleries to click from one image to the next while in the lightbox.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>One common problem with WordPress lightbox plugins is that they usually load their scripts and styles on every page, whether you need the lightbox there or not. WP Featherlight gives you the option in the post editor to disable the lightbox. It&#8217;s a handy option to have in case you don&#8217;t want to load a larger version of your images on that particular post/page, but I&#8217;m not sure why you wouldn&#8217;t just conditionally load the scripts on pages that have images.</p>\n<p>I tested WP Featherlight on a demo site and found that it works as advertised. You would be hard pressed to find a leaner lightbox plugin for WordPress. The style is super minimal and the fact that there are no options to configure makes it a pleasure to use. Many thanks to <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/fatmedia/" target="_blank">Robert Neu</a> and the folks at WP Site Care for making it freely <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-featherlight/" target="_blank">available on WordPress.org</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 19:36:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Developers Need to Communicate Better in Change Logs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45107";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-developers-need-to-communicate-better-in-change-logs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4839:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CommunicationFeaturedImage.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-15569" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CommunicationFeaturedImage.jpg?resize=637%2C200" alt="Communication Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elycefeliz/3224486233/">elycefeliz</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>One of the habits I developed when I started using WordPress is to <strong>always</strong> read a plugin&#8217;s changelog before updating. The changelog is a communication channel that bridges the gap between me and the developer.</p>\n<p>It tells me what&#8217;s changed, what to expect, and any other information the developer thinks I should know. The most important information a developer can tell me is that a security vulnerability has been addressed.</p>\n<p>Security vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins generally receive a decent amount of media coverage. If I read a story that mentions a plugin I use containing a vulnerability, the first thing I do is visit that plugin&#8217;s changelog on the WordPress plugin directory to see if it&#8217;s fixed. However, some plugin authors don&#8217;t do a very good job of informing users that a security patch has been applied.</p>\n<h2>WooCommerce and VaultPress</h2>\n<p>WooCommerce recently <a href="http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-2-3-11-patches-object-injection-vulnerability">released an update</a> to fix an object injection vulnerability. If you look at the changelog for 2.3.11 which has the patch, there is no mention of a security vulnerability being fixed.</p>\n<h4>2.3.11 &#8211; 10/06/2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Check if rating is enabled before check if rating is required to a review.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; get_discounted_price needs to check if taxes are enabled.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Fixed filetype check for digital downloads.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Newfoundland and Labrador state rename.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Escaped js in widget layered nav when use the dropdown option.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Switch the permissions check for json_search_products to use the read_product capability.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Fixed the addition of variable products using the Order API.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Sale item exclusion logic for variations.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Clear correct variation stock transients when setting stock.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Switch to JSON to avoid unserializing untrusted data when handling responses from PayPal.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; API &#8211; Fixed the sanitization for downloadable files on products endpoint.</li>\n<li>Tweak &#8211; woocommerce_downloadable_file_exists filter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To the untrained eye, 2.3.11 is just a regular maintenance release. Security fixes should be front and center and command attention.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/vaultpress/changelog/">VaultPress</a>, a security monitoring plugin by Automattic, also fails to provide clear information in its changelog. Determining security patches with VaultPress is confusing because security hotfixes are labeled as though they are patches for the plugin itself. Instead, security hotfixes are patches to protect from known security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h4>1.7.5 &#8211; 11 Jun 2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Security: Add a new security hotfix.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.4 &#8211; 28 Apr 2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix: Don&#8217;t allow openssl signing unless the public key exists.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.3 &#8211; 27 Apr 2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Security: Add a new security hotfix.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To add to the confusion, there&#8217;s no explanation as to what the hotfixes protect against. You have to read the <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1178685/vaultpress">inline comment on GitHub</a> to know what the latest hotfix does.</p>\n<blockquote><p>// Protect WooCommerce from object injection via PayPal IPN notifications. Affects 2.0.20 -&gt; 2.3.10</p></blockquote>\n<p>If VaultPress developers added the comment from GitHub to the changelog on WordPress.org, it would have made things a lot clearer.</p>\n<h2>Users Read Change Logs</h2>\n<p>When we <a href="http://wptavern.com/poll-how-often-do-you-read-a-wordpress-plugins-changelog-before-updating">asked readers</a> how often do they read a plugin&#8217;s changelog before updating, 705 out of 1,152 voters said they <strong>always</strong> read it while 338 people said they <strong>sometimes</strong> read it.

The goal was to maximize requests per second (RPS) with WordPress, Drupal 7, and MediaWiki, using their <a href="https://github.com/hhvm/oss-performance" target="_blank">oss-performance</a> benchmarking tool.</p>\n<p>&#8220;During lockdown we achieved a 19.4% RPS improvement for MediaWiki workloads, and a 1.8% RPS improvement for WordPress,&#8221; Facebook developer Paul Bissonnette reported. &#8220;We demonstrated that HHVM is 55.5% faster than PHP 7 on a MediaWiki workload, <strong>18.7% faster on a WordPress workload</strong>, and 10.2% faster on a Drupal 7 workload.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These results were based on configuring each framework with a sample dataset designed to approximate an average installation. In order to create the WordPress workload, the HHVM team used URLs from the hhvm.com access logs to extract data.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://hhvm.com/blog/9293/lockdown-results-and-hhvm-performance" target="_blank">report</a> contains a walkthrough of how the benchmarking tool works to approximate the maximum possible RPS of a server under a high load. Some of the most notable performance differences were summarized in the results of the engine comparison chart, which demonstrates the difference between PHP 5, PHP 7, and HHVM.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/engine-comparison.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/engine-comparison.png?resize=1025%2C429" alt="engine-comparison" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45141" /></a></p>\n<p>During the lockdown, the team also experimented with introducing asynchronous query execution to WordPress, the results of which the team plans to write about in the near future.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As an exercise, we evaluated the benefits of <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/tree/master/hphp/runtime/ext/async_mysql" target="_blank">async MySQL</a> in the WordPress environment. By modifying portions of WordPress to take advantage of the async capabilities offered by Hack and HHVM, we were able to examine the potential for performance gains through async execution. In our test environment we separated the MySQL and PHP hosting to separate machines within the same datacenter to approximate a realistic WordPress stack. The introduction of asynchronous query execution can demonstrate performance gains in both RPS and response time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see a more detailed report of the benefits they found from introducing async capabilities to WordPress. Overall, the lockdown provided an opportunity for collaboration across open source projects, resulting in a host of optimizations that will help OS frameworks perform better with HHVM in the future. The HHVM team plans to ship these improvements with the next release.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 17:47:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"Matt: Paul Ford: What is Code? | Bloomberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45145";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/paul-ford-what-is-code-bloomberg/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:376:"<blockquote><p>We are here because the editor of this magazine asked me, “Can you tell me what code is?”</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">Paul Ford&#8217;s amazing What is Code? for Bloomberg</a>.

The proposal is currently in the <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq" target="_blank">&#8220;Definition&#8221; phase</a>, which means that participants are working to design the community by proposing hypothetical questions that embody the topic&#8217;s scope.</p>\n<p>So far for WooCommerce, popular hypothetical questions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I handle the EU VATMOSS regulations in Woocommerce?</li>\n<li>How do I create an Order using WC REST API in my application?</li>\n<li>How to hide “add to cart” on free products?</li>\n<li>How to implement multiple versions of one digital product with different buyers&#8217; customizations?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to move on to the next milestone, the site must have at least 40 questions that have a score of at least ten net votes (up minus down). The WooCommerce staging site needs the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 more followers</li>\n<li>33 more questions with a score of 10 or more</li>\n<li>People to max out upvoting quality questions already in the proposal (users can only vote 5 times)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">StackExchange for general WordPress Development</a> is thriving with <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-stackexchange-thrives-in-2014-with-17-million-page-views-and-14k-new-questions" target="_blank">17 million page views and 14K new questions</a> in 2014. However, questions regarding third party plugins are considered off-topic and will be closed by moderators, hence the need for a separate WooCommerce Q&amp;A site.</p>\n<p>Alex Miller, one of the supporters of the WooCommerce StackExchange proposal, believes that the WooCommerce community needs a place where developers can quickly get answers to questions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WooCommerce Community Forums seemed like a decent place but was shut down months ago for unknown reasons,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My experience with the Woo Community Forums is that it was too broad and the upvote downvote system was poorly handled &#8211; good questions got buried too quickly with the large influx of new questions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In contrast, the StackExchange model pushes questions that have activity (edits, comments, answers) to the top of the frontpage and lower quality questions (downvoted, flagged) receive less attention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having a WooCommerce StackExchange site is also a great place for people with a great understanding of WooCommerce to document their knowledge for search engines to easily find,&#8221; Miller said. You can see an example of this by <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes" target="_blank">sorting the WPSE questions by votes</a> and reading the first few questions and answers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can only hope that with <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce" target="_blank">Automattic&#8217;s acquisition of WooCommerce</a>, the forums will be reopened (WooCommunity forums have been shutdown for a few months now),&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;But either way I don&#8217;t think there is a much better platform than what the StackExchange offers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As StackExchange Q&amp;A sites are entirely community driven, WooCommerce community members who are interested in seeing it succeed are encouraged to <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/login?returnurl=%2fproposals%2f80132%2fwoocommerce%3ftab%3dvotes" target="_blank">log into StackExchange</a> and create/upvote quality questions that represent the community&#8217;s interests.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 21:23:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: Customizer Typography: A Proof-of-Concept Plugin for WordPress Theme Authors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"http://wptavern.com/customizer-typography-a-proof-of-concept-plugin-for-wordpress-theme-authors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3644:"<p>One option that users often appreciate in themes is the ability to control typography without having to modify any code. Justin Tadlock has been experimenting with <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2015/06/08/customizer-typography-project" target="_blank">adding a typography control class for the WordPress customizer</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead of writing a lengthy tutorial, he opted to create a a proof-of-concept plugin that demonstrates how theme authors might accomplish this. <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/customizer-typography" target="_blank">Customizer Typography</a> is currently being developed on GitHub and Tadlock said it is &#8220;only meant for development purposes and to show one method of executing the idea.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/customize-typography-screen.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/customize-typography-screen.png?resize=1025%2C568" alt="customize-typography-screen" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45019" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin was created to provide testing for two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Testing a customizer control class to handle typography</li>\n<li>Tying multiple customize settings to a single control</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The most important was not having to add tons of code while still providing the developer complete control over each setting,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Fortunately, the Customization API in WordPress is pretty powerful and allows you to tie multiple settings to a single control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The plugin currently provides controls for live previewing both paragraph and headings with various font family, font weight, font style, font size, and line height options. <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/customizer-typography/blob/master/customize/control-typography.php#L207" target="_blank">Integrating Google Fonts</a> is on Tadlock&#8217;s to-do list, but at the moment he&#8217;s not working to build out the plugin as the ultimate solution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just to be clear, this is a proof of concept that I put together in an afternoon, not a polished solution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The idea, for me at least, would be to eventually extract it and put it into themes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I installed the plugin to play around with Twenty Fifteen and found that the experience of live previewing typography changes is very satisfying from a user standpoint. Although many custom theme options panels include basic typography controls, you often have to refresh the page to see how your changes applied. This kind of control is a prime candidate for integrating into the customizer.</p>\n<p>Tadlock&#8217;s example typography control class gives you a glimpse of what&#8217;s possible for theme authors who elect to build their options using the customizer. It&#8217;s these kinds of controls that truly solve a frustration and make it easier to personalize themes. The Customizer Typography plugin exemplifies the purpose of the customizer.</p>\n<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/customizer-typography" target="_blank">check out the plugin on GitHub</a> and install it to see the live previews in action.

At the time, Ben Gillbanks, the library&#8217;s maintainer, estimated 95% of all commercial WordPress themes supported TimThumb.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2014, a <a href="http://wptavern.com/100000-wordpress-sites-compromised-using-the-slider-revolution-security-vulnerability">security vulnerability was discovered</a> in the Slider Revolution plugin that allowed more than 100k websites to be compromised.</p>\n<p>Using third-party scripts and libraries is not a bad thing. The practice however, comes with a set of risks. It&#8217;s up to developers to be vigilant and accept the responsibilities that come with relying on a third-party. It&#8217;s also imperative that developers do everything they can to update their products and users when a security vulnerability is discovered.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer, let us know the criteria in determining which third-party scripts, libraries, and tools you use.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 20:31:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"Post Status: Quick tip: Disconnect Jetpack from the WordPress.com side";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=12963";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"https://poststatus.com/quick-tip-disconnect-jetpack-from-the-wordpress-com-side/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2528:"<p>About sixteen months ago, I wrote a post noting that it is <a href="https://poststatus.com/managing-jetpack-enabled-blogs-wordpress-com/">really annoying to disconnect a WordPress.com account from a Jetpack install</a>. More annoying yet, is that you could not get rid of nonexistent Jetpack enabled websites from the WordPress.com &#8220;My Sites&#8221; section at all without contacting support.</p>\n<p>Over the years I collected quite a few Jetpack enabled websites connected to my WordPress.com username. Whether I was connecting a staging site or was too lazy to get a friend to setup their own account on WordPress.com, I ended up with a couple of dozen websites connected to my account that were not in my control.</p>\n<p>The traditional way to disconnect Jetpack from WordPress.com was via the site admin in the Jetpack settings. But over time, many of the sites I managed have went stagnant or completely offline, and there was no way to disconnect them anymore. But finally, you can disconnect Jetpack from the WordPress.com side.</p>\n<p>You can disconnect sites from the main &#8220;My Site&#8221; link (shown above) or the individual site (pictured below). Errored sites show up with a red warning side, and when you click the icon, the ability to permanently disconnect the site appears.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12965" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-com-disconnect-solo-752x385.png" alt="wp-com-disconnect-solo" width="752" height="385" /></p>\n<p>This has been a near daily annoyance of mine for years. I&#8217;m happy to see it finally get resolution. Special thanks to Automattician <a href="https://twitter.com/jeherve/status/606369302216728576">Jeremy Herve</a> for never forgetting about me.</p>\n<p>One more tip: if you go to your WordPress.com homepage often, and it doesn&#8217;t open up the page you want to be default for stats, you can set your default site under your <a href="https://wordpress.com/me/account">account settings</a>. This is another annoyance of mine that I didn&#8217;t know had a solution until just now.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12966" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-com-account-752x377.jpg" alt="wp-com-account" width="752" height="377" /></p>\n<p>I know creating really effective user interfaces and account management tools is really hard. But attention to small details is awesome. I&#8217;m glad the WordPress.com team took care of this one, even if it took a while.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 18:18:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"Matt: Peter Thiel on MBAs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45140";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/peter-thiel-on-mbas/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:877:"<blockquote><p>I think one challenge a lot of the business schools have is they end up attracting students who are very extroverted and have very low conviction, and they put them in this hot house environment for a few years — at the end of which, a large number of people go into whatever was the last trendy thing to do. They’ve done studies at Harvard Business School where they’ve found that the largest cohort always went into the wrong field.

In it he clarified the reasons why he and several other core contributors are committed to iterating the customizer and identified the feature as a means of building user trust through live previews.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being able to make non-destructive changes and preview them is an important component of building that trust. This is perhaps most noticeable in the “save and surprise” approach of the widgets admin screen – every time you add a new widget, modify its settings, or move one around, the changes are saved and appear live on your site, even if you’re not ready yet. The customizer is our framework for live previewing changes. We are committed to providing live preview for all aspects of site customization and making it usable on all devices from phones to large screens.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Boren briefly summarized the history of the customizer and alluded to a few possibilities the framework may offer in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The customizer has come a long way, but it still lacks some features and needs time to mature. We have many improvements planned and in progress, including transactions, partial refresh, theme installation, speedier loading, scaling to large screens, and possibly even integration with front end editing. Our live preview framework offers many possibilities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Menu Customizer plugin was <a href="http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-tentatively-approved-for-wordpress-4-3" target="_blank">tentatively approved for merge</a> during last week&#8217;s core development meeting. In order for the it to be officially approved for merge on June 17th, the plugin will need to meet the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/how-the-release-cycle-works/features-as-plugins/" target="_blank">feature plugin criteria</a> outlined in the core handbook.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have eight days to get the Menu Customizer plugin ready for merge,&#8221; Boren said. During this time the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/flow/" target="_blank">flow team</a> will be testing and documenting the flow and visuals for the menu customizer.</p>\n<p>Boren invited anyone who wants to contribute to this effort to create flow comparisons of the existing flow through Appearance > Menus versus flow through the customizer. This essentially involves walking through the experience of setting up menus, taking screenshots of the flow, and publishing them as a captioned gallery.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please help us capture the flows through Appearance > Menus used by you and your clients,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need this information to ensure our new interfaces are mindful and aware of how WordPress is actually used.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Anyone can contribute to WordPress in this way, as it doesn&#8217;t require any coding. The core team is looking for people to capture real user scenarios to help in making the final decision.</p>\n<h3>There is No Timeline for Removing the Appearance > Menus Screen</h3>\n<p>In the original <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/03/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-menu-customizer/" target="_blank">merge proposal</a> for the Menu Customizer the plugin&#8217;s author, Nick Halsey, outlined what he called a &#8220;fairly aggressive&#8221; plan for the removal of the old menus admin screen. As contributor resources are scarce when it comes to the Menus component, Halsey favored focusing all new development on the UI in the customizer.</p>\n<p>The timeline he outlined was for WordPress 4.3 to point the Menus link in the admin bar to Menus in the customizer and later releases (WordPress 4.5 or 4.6) would remove all core links to the Menus admin screen.</p>\n<p>WordPress users reacted strongly to this aggressive timeline for removing the old menus screen, but the timeline was merely a suggestion as part of the proposal. Halsey was not keen on merging the plugin without a definitive timeline for removing the old menus, a factor which he considered a &#8220;<a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1433384682001602" target="_blank">dealbreaker</a>&#8221; for merge.</p>\n<p>However, WordPress 4.3 release lead Konstantin Obenland confirmed that no official timeline has been set.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/pollyplummer">@pollyplummer</a> There is no timeline either way.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Konstantin Obenland (@obenland) <a href="https://twitter.com/obenland/status/608377778933743616">June 9, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ryan Boren also confirmed that WordPress will continue to maintain the Appearance > Menus screen should the plugin be officially approved for merge in the coming days:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the Appearance screens will remain and will be maintained. Appearance > Menus recently received some attention in the form of a few fixes. More attention is needed and will be given. There are still differences in the flows each approach best enables, whether it’s new site/theme setup, small maintenance tasks, or dedicated content managers for heavy usage of widgets, menus, or other pieces of content that benefit from having a preview mechanism. We should gather quantifiable metrics when it comes to performance and time to completion for a given flow, as well as evaluating the less-objectively-quantifiable perceived performance. <strong>There may come a time where the worlds converge; however, that time is not now.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This confirmation should assuage those whose opposition to the Menu Customizer was solely based on the aggressive timeline proposed for removing the old menus screen.</p>\n<p>The great divide on the Menu Customizer revolves around one aspect of improvement that Boren mentioned in his paragraph about the future of the customizer: <strong>scaling to large screens</strong>. The vast majority of WordPress users and developers who are following this debate are those who would be more likely to configure a menu in a desktop environment and not via mobile (where the customizer is currently designed to shine).</p>\n<p>Many who oppose the merge of the plugin have identified the cramped UI as the primary reason that it does not provide a better experience for users. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who is opposed to live previews or better usability on mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Those who manage WordPress sites via desktop are not willing to sacrifice the old menus screen for a new UI that currently caters primarily to smaller devices. Until the Menu Customizer can adequately provide a UI that fully adapts to all screen sizes, resistance to the feature is likely to continue.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 09 Jun 2015 22:34:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Matt: Trust but Preview";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45138";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/trust-but-preview/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:273:"<p>If you&#8217;re following along with the customizer and menu work for the next version of WordPress, check out <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/">Trust, Live Preview, and Menus in the Customizer</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 09 Jun 2015 20:00:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"WPTavern: Introducing the WP Tavern Wapuu";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=44960";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"http://wptavern.com/introducing-the-wp-tavern-wapuu";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6761:"<p>The <a href="http://wapuu.jp/">Wapuu craze</a> has spread far and wide.

She doesn&#8217;t plan on writing tutorials to modify the base Wapuu. Instead, she is creating <a href="https://github.com/marktimemedia/my-wapuu">a base Wapuu</a> that will have separated pieces so its easier to modify.</p>\n<p>She often sketches and re-draws Wapuus that are not in their normal position.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Actually, most of the Wapuus are slightly modified to make it easier for them to hold or interact with their elements. I thought of him like a cartoon character (fluid) more so than a logo or icon (rigid),&#8221; Schulp told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Schulp has always had an interest in sketching cartoons. For WordCamp Miami 2015, she created a variety of custom-made My Little Pony stickers.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MyLittlePonyStickers.jpg"><img class="wp-image-44978 size-large" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MyLittlePonyStickers.jpg?resize=309%2C500" alt="My Little Pony Stickers" /></a>My Little Pony Stickers\n<p>She also uses her skills to create <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/marktimemedia/developer-collaboration">unique slide decks</a> filled with colorful illustrations.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CustomSlideDeck.png"><img class="wp-image-44983 size-large" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CustomSlideDeck.png?resize=500%2C415" alt="Custom Slide Deck" /></a>Custom Slide Deck\n<h2>From WordCamps to Websites and Eventually Companies</h2>\n<p>Wapuu is considered the official mascot character of WordPress and was designed by Kazuko Kaneuchi in 2011. It’s <a href="https://github.com/jawordpressorg/wapuu" target="_blank">distributed under the GPLv2 or later</a> and can be modified by anyone. The character is used to represent different cultures and regions of the world.</p>\n<p>Now that Wapuu is showing up as a mascot for sites that focus on WordPress, the question is, when will it be used to represent companies in the WordPress ecosystem?</p>\n<p>Shortly after <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce">Automattic acquired WooThemes</a>, Nick Hamze was criticized on the Advanced WordPress Facebook group for creating a <a href="http://blog.nickhamze.com/2015/05/19/hiro-wapuu-bffs/">Wapuu dressed up like a ninja</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If the graphic was created by WooThemes and independently of the acquisition I&#8217;d think oh cute, WooTheme&#8217;s mascot is teaching WordPress&#8217; mascot how to be a ninja, best friends forever for sure.</p>\n<p>Instead, it came from an Automattician and in the context of Automattic acquiring WooThemes, to me it reads that Automattic is using Wapuu, which just bugs me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At WordCamp Miami 2015, Rocketgenius came under fire for creating swag that features Wapuu wearing a space suit with a rocket patch on its arm.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock">@carlhancock</a> Wapuu is for promoting WordPress.

The logo is subtle in nature and if you didn&#8217;t already know it represents Rocketgenius, it would fit naturally into the design.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SpaceWapuu.jpg"><img class="wp-image-44989 size-large" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SpaceWapuu.jpg?resize=375%2C500" alt="Space Wapuu With Rocket Patch" /></a>Space Wapuu With Rocket Patch\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that there are no rules in how Wapuu can be used. The only guideline is maintaining Kaneuchi&#8217;s copyright.

Unlike the WordPress logo, which is trademarked, Wapuu is free of such restrictions meaning anyone can use it for anything, including commercial endeavors.</p>\n<p>The community needs to protect Wapuu from enterprises that want to claim it as their own. We must respect its origins and give credit where credit is due.

BuddyPress enthusiasts will learn more about the varied uses of the plugin and will also have the opportunity to get connected to core contributors in the region.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If people go home happy and inspired to use BuddyPress to help them grow a community, then I&#8217;ll be very happy,&#8221; Gibbs said.</p>\n<p>Those interested to attend can <a href="http://brighton.buddycamp.org/" target="_blank">subscribe to email updates</a> or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/BuddyCampUK" target="_blank">@BuddyCampUK</a> on Twitter to be notified when tickets go on sale.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 08 Jun 2015 22:06:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:101:"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Review Team Seeks Feedback on the Review Process, Themes, and the Directory";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=44912";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:109:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-seeks-feedback-on-the-review-process-themes-and-the-directory";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5390:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/survey.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/survey.jpg?resize=1025%2C507" alt="photo credit: Lukasz Kowalewski" class="size-full wp-image-44957" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/FI3UYVGNFD">Lukasz Kowalewski</a>\n<p>The WordPress Theme Review Team (TRT) is currently seeking feedback via three separate surveys on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-review-process-survey/" target="_blank">review process</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-usability-survey/" target="_blank">themes</a>, and the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-directory-survey/" target="_blank">directory</a>. After weathering several months of increasingly negative community feedback, the team is now looking to users and theme authors to help shape its <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/suggested-roadmap/" target="_blank">roadmap</a> for the future.</p>\n<p>The team&#8217;s controversial decision to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options" target="_blank">require theme authors to use the customizer for building theme options</a> ignited a heated debate, which continued as more guidelines came up for consideration. Community members expressed concern that more rules and regulations might limit the future of WordPress themes. The conversation surrounding violations of the &#8220;<a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-is-cracking-down-on-violations-of-the-presentation-vs-functionality-guideline" target="_blank">Presentation vs. Functionality</a>&#8221; guideline contributed to the team&#8217;s decision to reevaluate the general direction of the official directory and the process of getting a theme approved.</p>\n<p>Following a brainstorming session with Matt Mullenweg on May 28th, the TRT decided to step back and look at the process and the directory in a new way. This opened up many new avenues for the team to explore, and the three user surveys are a response to the new direction.</p>\n<p>TRT member Tammie Lister opened up the feedback channels with an <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-directory-survey/" target="_blank">overview</a> of the purpose behind the surveys:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As a part of our <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/suggested-roadmap/" target="_blank">Theme Directory Roadmap</a>, we are going to be taking a good look at every aspect of the theme submission, review, and browsing experience on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>To kick off the research phase of our roadmap, we’re issuing a series of surveys targeting theme authors, theme reviewers, and WordPress users. In addition to surveying users, we’ll also be analyzing other theme directories on the web, and reviewing other theme submission processes to see what we can bring back to WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-usability-survey/" target="_blank">Usability survey</a> is an opportunity for anyone who has ever used a WordPress.org-hosted theme to voice an opinion on that experience. The survey briefly touches on whether the user views a demo before downloading the theme. The quality of theme demos is currently a hot topic of discussion, as many believe that the current demos are woefully inadequate at showing a theme&#8217;s potential.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-review-process-survey/" target="_blank">Theme Review Process survey</a> is specifically for theme authors and includes open-ended questions regarding the process and obstacles to getting a theme launched.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://13233232.polldaddy.com/s/what-is-it-like-to-have-your-theme-reviewed" target="_blank">Finding a WordPress Theme</a> survey concerns the directory, but it is the most limited in scope. The survey includes just one question about where users look for a theme when starting a new site.</p>\n<p>One WordPress theme developer <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-directory-survey/#comment-41962" target="_blank">commented on the survey</a>, suggesting a few more detailed questions that could be helpful, but Lister indicated that the TRT is examining the first round of responses before moving on to further research.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At this stage we should not get into too much detail as we want to get an over-view. We also have some stats we can use in conjunction. This is not something we’re going to change format wise this time around.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The three surveys are a unique opportunity for users to voice their opinions on the experience of using WordPress.org themes, and take just minutes to complete. Hopefully, when the next stage of research is launched they will survey users on more specific concerns.</p>\n<p>The TRT&#8217;s request for feedback marks the beginning of a radical shift in the direction of the team. Instead of instituting more guidelines, TRT is looking at better ways to encourage creativity among theme authors and improve the process of submitting themes. The directory should also be receiving some useful improvements in the near future as the result of user feedback.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 08 Jun 2015 19:02:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.1.2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1849";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://blog.akismet.com/2015/06/08/akismet-3-1-2-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1209:"<p>Version 3.1.2 of <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.</p>\n<p>This update includes seventeen fixes and enhancements; they&#8217;re summarized in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/changelog/">changelog</a> (or for all of the details, the <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk">revision log</a>), but notably, Akismet will be easier to set up, use less space in your database, and be better protected against security holes &#8212; specifically ones in other plugins.</p>\n<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.

When we look at rockstars in the WordPress community, we typically look at developers, designers, and marketers. Little is known about the documentation writers out there who shed their blood, sweat, and tears to ensure everything runs smoothly.</p>\n<p>This post is about those who day in, and day out stare at endless lines of code to decipher what the developer was thinking, and the true meaning behind the code that exists.</p>\n<h2>Good Documentation is More Than Words</h2>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DocumentationWords.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-44914" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DocumentationWords.png" alt="Documentation Words" width="730" height="295" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/80719942@N00/4733367729">Variatie &#8211; Tekst</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>Good documentation writers provide more than an instruction manual, they provide an experience. I have known excellent documenters, coached beginners, and the largest difference between them is understanding the brain of those reading it. Just like a novel, documentation has a flow that keeps the reader interested and ingesting more information than they realize.</p>\n<p>Quality documentation targets the users that are most likely to read it. It also provides a point of reference for those who are more unlikely to read it. For example, if documenting a particular hook, it’s typically assumed that a developer will be reading it, but what about those who have little development experience?</p>\n<p>A good documentation writer will provide a point of reference for those who need more of a push in the right direction, without the need to contact support to spell it out for them.</p>\n<h2>Documentation Has a Larger Impact Than You Think</h2>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ImpactImage.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-44916" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ImpactImage.png" alt="Impact Image" width="585" height="298" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24113168@N03/3891599149">Eruption</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>Most simply ignore documentation, pushing it off into the endless abyss until they can’t take it anymore. I’m guilty of the same thing in some cases. What those people don’t realize, is that every moment their plugin or theme is left undocumented, user experience suffers.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at your most common support ticket. If you better documented that issue, would those tickets go away entirely? Probably not. Would you get fewer tickets regarding the issue as well as increase you or your support agent&#8217;s productivity? I guarantee it. I think we could all use fewer support tickets.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned previously, documentation makes a dramatic impact on user experience. If the user is able to locate the information easily and efficiently, they have saved their own time as well as yours. The average world life expectancy is 66.57 years and your users would rather be doing something else with their lives than fiddling around with poorly written documentation.</p>\n<p>If a customer sees that you have put quite a bit of time and effort into your documentation, they will, whether consciously or not, better appreciate you. Good documentation shows you care about them after the initial sale.</p>\n<p>Have you ever been left high and dry after spending hard-earned money and soon regretted the purchase? I think we all have. With proper documentation, you can avoid passing that feeling off to your customers.</p>\n<h2>How Can You Write Better Documentation?</h2>\n<p>The first step is to stop avoiding it. Once you&#8217;re good at it, writing documentation is more of a pleasurable experience than you think. In fact, it will become second nature. Just like everything else in the world, practice makes perfect.</p>\n<p>One of the first steps you want to take when deciding to take your documentation to the next level is to determine your pain points. What are you being contacted about? If you start blindly writing about things, you may find that what you’re writing about isn’t making as much of an impact you would like it to.</p>\n<p>One of the best techniques I have discovered is to track the number of tickets that are documented vs. those that are not, and break those that are not into categories. This way, you can better target your pain points, and revise the parts that may not be as helpful as they should be.</p>\n<p>After you have determined what documentation you should write, you should determine your target audience, and break it down into developers, users, and power users. This helps you cater to that particular audience. We’ll go over how to target those users a bit later.</p>\n<p>Next, you want to break down the document. For developers, you’ll want to break it down into raw information (accepted arguments, return values, etc.), specific examples and use-cases. For users, the best course of action is a walkthrough. Every step they will need to take, regardless of how trivial it may seem, is critical.</p>\n<p>Spell it out to them every step of the way. Documenting for power users is very similar to a user scenario, but more structured and scannable. Be clear, but allow them to easily jump to where they need to go without reading the previous step first.</p>\n<h2>The Art of Writing Better Documentation</h2>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DocumentationArt.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-44917" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DocumentationArt.png" alt="Documentation Art" width="497" height="249" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/41455403@N00/458033123">Space invader. Paris. Gare de lyon</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>When it comes to the art of writing your documentation, write in a way that best targets your audience, but also use simple language that you know they will understand. One of the best reasons for this is due to translations. While Google translate does an excellent job, it’s much easier to translate the simple vocabulary of a 5th grader than that contained within a post-grad thesis.</p>\n<p>Within your content, don’t be afraid to link to relevant content. This will allow you to avoid repeating yourself through multiple documents, as well as allow the reader to back-track if they need more information about a particular subject. After all, your main goals are to make the user happy, and save yourself time.</p>\n<p>The documentation process doesn’t stop after you press the <strong>publish</strong> button. Go back and revise every document as needed. Almost immediately after the document is published, go back and see if the support tickets you tracked have declined, and traffic to that particular article has increased. Usually, if you’re getting more traffic to an article, it’s helping. If you’re getting more traffic but the same number of support tickets, you may want to look into that article to see why.</p>\n<h2>What We Have Learned</h2>\n<p>First, I hope that after making it this far, you have a better appreciation for those in the trenches writing the documentation that most of us take for granted. It truly is an art form that many of us who write documentation for a living truly enjoy and put many, many hours into.</p>\n<p>I also hope that you come away from this article thinking more about your existing documentation and how it can be improved. Proper documentation can be extremely rewarding and once in practice, can actually be quite fun to write.</p>\n<p>Document early, document often. A great product is more than great code, it’s also beautifully documented.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 05 Jun 2015 21:26:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: Menu Customizer Tentatively Approved for WordPress 4.3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=44894";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-tentatively-approved-for-wordpress-4-3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2520:"<p>WordPress 4.3 release lead Konstantin Obenland posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/05/dev-chat-summary-june-3/" target="_blank">notes</a> from this week&#8217;s core development chat, confirming that the <a href="http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-officially-proposed-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-3" target="_blank">Menu Customizer</a> plugin has been conditionally approved to merge.

It provides a BP core-supported method of managing user-submitted files and opens up a world of possibilities for plugin developers.</p>\n<p>The API powers the new avatar uploads UI, but it can also be used to extend BuddyPress to add media sharing capabilities. If you want to see a good example of this in the wild, check out BuddyDrive version <a href="https://github.com/imath/buddydrive/tree/1.3" target="_blank">1.3.0</a>. The plugin was created by BP core developer <a href="http://imathi.eu/" target="_blank">Mathieu Viet</a>, who led the effort to get the BP Attachments API into the latest release.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddydrive/" target="_blank">BuddyDrive</a> allows members to share a file or a list of files with the community and includes various settings for restricting access. It&#8217;s essentially like a Dropbox clone for BuddyPress, designed to enhance collaboration between members. The plugin was a prime candidate for adapting the BP Attachments API to power community file sharing in a simpler, more elegant way.</p>\n<p>You can see it active in the new &#8220;BuddyDrive Editor&#8221; included in version 1.3, demonstrated in the video below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Viet posted an <a href="https://github.com/imath/buddydrive/wiki/The-BuddyDrive-Editor" target="_blank">example function</a> in the plugin&#8217;s wiki to show how the BuddyDrive Editor can be placed anywhere. The feature is a good example of how easy it is for developers to leverage the API to manage user-generated media from the frontend.</p>\n<p>BuddyDrive 1.3 is currently in beta and on track to be released soon. If you&#8217;d like to help test the beta or inspect the code to see how it works, you can download a zip file from Viet&#8217;s <a href="http://imathi.eu/2015/06/02/buddydrive-1-3-0/" target="_blank">preview post</a>. The unreleased <a href="https://github.com/imath/buddydrive/tree/1.3" target="_blank">version 1.3</a> is also available on GitHub.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about using the new BP Attachments API, check out Viet&#8217;s comprehensive <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/plugindev/bp_attachment/" target="_blank">BP codex article</a>. It walks you through extending the <code>BP_Attachment</code> class to validate and store files in a subdirectory of wp-content/uploads. The documentation also includes a sample plugin to demonstrate how you might add attachments to private messages.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 05 Jun 2015 04:20:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"WPTavern: How to Add a Default Image to Jetpack’s Related Posts Module";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=44865";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://wptavern.com/how-to-add-a-default-image-to-jetpacks-related-posts-module";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2712:"<p>Jetpack&#8217;s related posts module is a great way to show related content without using the same server resources used to host a site.

All official EDD themes (those that are built by the EDD core team) are now 100% free. This includes half a dozen themes that are guaranteed to be fully compatible with EDD, including the new <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/vendd/" target="_blank">Vendd</a> theme launching today.</p>\n<p>EDD support manager Sean Davis clarified how the free themes will be supported:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Official EDD themes are available to you at absolutely no cost. They will still be licensed so that you can receive theme updates directly from your WordPress dashboard and we will also provide support. The only thing changing is the price.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Responding to <a href="https://twitter.com/nphaskins/status/606478597851746304" target="_blank">criticism</a> on Twitter saying that the change contributes to the <a href="https://philiparthurmoore.com/ruining-wordpress/" target="_blank">undervaluation of WordPress themes</a>, EDD founder <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/" target="_blank">Pippin Williamson</a> said, &#8220;For us it&#8217;s not about the themes. It&#8217;s about the entire package. By making it easy for users to have a good shop up and running in minutes, we significantly increase the potential value to that customer and of that customer. We also dramatically reduce the cost of support by having more users on more reliable themes that are built for EDD.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Making half a dozen themes free might seem like it would significantly increase EDD&#8217;s support burden, but Williamson expects that the move will pay off in other ways. Like many other WordPress business owners who have made some of their best work free, Williamson has a strategy for how it will work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The change lowers the barrier to entry,&#8221; Williamson said. &#8220;When the barrier is lowered, the user base grows. When the user base grows, the customer base grows. From a business side, we will have far more success converting free users to paid customers after they&#8217;ve already been given a great experience with a theme.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/nphaskins">@nphaskins</a> Not sugar coating it at all.

Last year, he <a href="http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenwegs-state-of-the-word-highlights-internationalization-mobile-and-new-tools-for-wordpress-contributors" target="_blank">announced</a> that the the event had outgrown the Mission Bay venue and that it would be expanding to become WordCamp US in 2015.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Touch the walls as you walk out, as this is the last time we''ll have <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampSF?src=hash">#WordCampSF</a> here! ~ <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt">@photomatt</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcsf14?src=hash">#wcsf14</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/endofanera?src=hash">#endofanera</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp SF (@WordCampSF) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampSF/status/526454529584549889">October 26, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The decision to seek a new venue in a new city was partly based on the need to make room for more attendees and presentations. Another benefit of moving the event out of San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the world, is that it will likely become more accessible to a greater number of people.</p>\n<p>WordCamp US will follow a format similar to WordCamp Europe in that it will be held in a rotating city. The city has not yet been selected, which is surprising given that the year is nearly halfway finished.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg put out <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/06/wordcamp-us-survey/" target="_blank">a call for host city applications</a> on his blog and linked to a <a href="http://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/apply-to-host-wordcamp-us" target="_blank">survey</a> where candidates can apply.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of cities out there that might be an excellent fit for WordCamp US, but many are lacking a vibrant local WordPress community to help support the event. While this is not stated as an explicit requirement, it would be difficult to pull off such a large event without an army of local volunteers.</p>\n<p>WordPress is aiming big for its first ever WordCamp US. The survey states that host city applicants must secure a venue with hotels within three miles that can support 1,500 &#8211; 2,000 attendees. Potential organizers must supply average hotel costs for a range of budgets and average flight costs from the West Coast, East Coast, Midwest, Mexico, and Canada.</p>\n<p>Hosting the event will be a massive undertaking that will require an organization team capable of putting everything together in a very short amount of time. Events of this size normally have the benefit of longer planning periods. For example, <a href="http://wptavern.com/applications-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2016-closing-soon" target="_blank">applications to host WordCamp Europe 2016 closed two months ago</a> and the team is already training volunteers for next year&#8217;s event.</p>\n<p>If your team is up to the challenge of hosting WordCamp US, you&#8217;ll need to be prepared to submit venue information with room capacities, a detailed event budget, potential dates, and contributor day options. So far, Mullenweg has received in-person pitches for Phoenix but the application process is open to teams from any city.

I do this about once a week now since I can accumulate 20-100 new subscriptions in that time. This code will break if they change anything, but should be pretty easy to update when they do. It currently shows me as unsubscribed from 7,868 things!

Development on the 2.3 release cycle began in March with contributors <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-development-kicks-off-contributors-prioritize-work-on-new-apis" target="_blank">prioritizing work on new APIs</a> alongside improvements to BuddyPress&#8217; existing APIs. Here&#8217;s a quick overview of what&#8217;s new:</p>\n<h4>BP Attachments API</h4>\n<p>The highlight of this release is the <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/plugindev/bp_attachment/" target="_blank">BP Attachments API</a>, a new library that enables developers to create components that have the ability to manage uploads. You can see it in action in the greatly <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-will-improve-avatar-uploads-with-the-new-bp-attachments-api" target="_blank">improved avatar uploads UI</a>, which now supports drag-and-drop uploads and includes mobile integration with phone/tablet/laptop cameras.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/avatar-ui.gif"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/avatar-ui.gif" alt="avatar-ui" width="657" height="355" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44742" /></a></p>\n<h4>Companion Stylesheets for WordPress Default Themes</h4>\n<p>If you want to test BuddyPress and you&#8217;re not sure which theme to use, check out one of WordPress&#8217; most recent default themes. Version 2.3 of the plugin ships with <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-will-introduce-companion-stylesheets-for-wordpress-default-themes" target="_blank">companion stylesheets</a> for Twenty Fourteen and Twenty Fifteen, which tidy up the appearance of BuddyPress components and UI elements when the default themes are active. The stylesheets also introduce vertical menus that eliminate the crowding often seen in the horizontal user/group navigation.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bp-user-account-nav.png"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bp-user-account-nav.png" alt="bp-user-account-nav" width="1300" height="1004" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43323" /></a></p>\n<h4>Better Excerpts for Blog Post Activity</h4>\n<p>Version 2.3 has better support for blog post activity items. If the Site Tracking component is activated, BuddyPress will now display better excerpts in the activity stream for posts containing images or other embedded media. This improvement pairs nicely with the custom post type support that was added to the activity stream in the <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-spumoni-released-featuring-new-member-type-api" target="_blank">2.2. release</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/activity-stream-blog-post.jpg"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/activity-stream-blog-post.jpg" alt="activity-stream-blog-post" width="616" height="443" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44744" /></a></p>\n<p>Other highlights in BuddyPress 2.3 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Member Type Directories</strong> – Create directories of member types on your site using the <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/developer/member-types/" target="_blank">Member Type API</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Star Private Messages</strong> – Mark important messages in your inbox with a star.</li>\n<li><strong>Notification Meta</strong> – Notifications are now more extensible with an additional metadata table.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall this release offers an excellent balance between new features and improvements upon existing features, which combine to make BuddyPress more extensible and more enjoyable to use. It includes hundreds of bug fixes and enhancements from 40 volunteer contributors.

Nick Halsey posted the Customizer Team&#8217;s <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/03/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-menu-customizer/" target="_blank">proposal</a> last night, beginning with a summary of the purpose of moving menu management into the customizer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the process, we hope to offer an updated design with improved user flow, a mobile-first interface, improved accessibility, rebuild the administration UI from the ground up to be JavaScript-driven, solve long-standing problems with the current implementation, and clarify the purposes and capabilities of the menus feature. Additionally, Menu Customizer contributes significantly to the long-term goal to move all appearance functionality and, really, everything that could benefit from live previewing, from the admin to the Customizer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Menu management in the customizer is essentially a full replacement of all the capabilities previously housed in the admin. It allows for editing, reordering, deleting, and adding individual menu items within any menu. The plugin adds a convenient global search that includes all post types, terms, and taxonomies.</p>\n<p>The video below was prepared by Halsey&#8217;s team to demonstrate the capabilities of the Menu Customizer:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The dizzying speed with which she flips between panels in the demo is not representative of the capabilities of your average WordPress user. Given that the plugin currently requires WordPress 4.3 alpha, it&#8217;s not likely that it has not been widely tested by users of varying experience levels.</p>\n<p>My initial impression after testing is that managing menus in the customizer makes me feel claustrophobic. The live previews and the mobile friendliness are the big wins here, but they come at the expense of a squished menu management experience. For sites that use WordPress as a CMS, with dozens and sometimes hundreds of pages and subpages, menu management in the customizer could become rather cumbersome.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/menu-customizer-test-add-page.jpg"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/menu-customizer-test-add-page.jpg" alt="menu-customizer-test-add-page" width="848" height="644" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44768" /></a></p>\n<p>I have no doubt that the Menu Customizer has been architected to perform better as a JavaScript-driven solution for managing menus. Halsey and the team employed no small amount of wizardry in creating the custom panel for implementing screen options and the sections that lazy load menu items.</p>\n<p>But if you put a relatively new WordPress user in front of the customizer menu panel, will it be intuitive to use?  Will stuffing menus into the customizer cause the usability of the feature to decline?</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/962590793803135/" target="_blank">Reactions to the proposal</a> in the Advanced WordPress Facebook group were less than enthusiastic, as not many favor expanding the customizer&#8217;s reach into menu management.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t feel the Customizer is the correct place to <em>manage</em> menus or any content for that matter,&#8221; member Tom Hemsley commented. &#8220;If a theme offers <em>styling</em> options for a menu then fair enough &#8211; put those styling options in the customizer. But the customizer is not the place for managing content. Why not force people to create new posts using the Customizer, too?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lisa League&#8217;s comment accurately summarizes many others&#8217; initial reactions to the demo video: &#8220;My first impression of Make was not &#8216;Cool, look how they did this with the customizer&#8217; but &#8216;Whoa, there&#8217;s too much stuff in this tiny space.''&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the Menu Customizer plugin is approved to merge into core, Halsey outlined a plan for the removal of the old menu admin screen in favor of focusing all new development on the UI in the customizer. WordPress 4.3 would point the Menus link in the admin bar to Menus in the customizer and later releases would remove all core links to the Menus admin screen, or point them to the customizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The above plan is fairly aggressive, to eliminate any ambiguity about future plans and intentions and to avoid the potential for mass trac ticket rot,&#8221; Halsey said.</p>\n<p>WordPress cannot move forward without making changes and taking risks. The question of whether or not to merge the Menu Customizer plugin should inspire some fairly active discussion in the days ahead. If you want to test the plugin for yourself, the easiest way is to install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" target="_blank">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin to get 4.3-alpha running and then install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-customizer" target="_blank">Menu Customizer</a> from WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Core contributors will discuss the Menu Customizer proposal today during the regularly scheduled development meeting on Slack. According to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-3-project-schedule/" target="_blank">WordPress 4.3 project schedule</a>, the feature plugin merge window will close June 17th and the official release is expected in mid-August.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 03 Jun 2015 18:15:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: Steven Gliebe Launches WordPress Commercial Plugin Directory";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=44649";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://wptavern.com/steven-gliebe-launches-wordpress-commercial-plugin-directory";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6532:"<p>More than 38k plugins are available for free on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress plugin directory</a>.

Outside of <a href="http://codecanyon.net/">CodeCanyon</a>, I&#8217;m not aware of any WordPress plugin directory that focuses on commercial plugins.</p>\n<h2>Introducing Pro Plugin Directory</h2>\n<p>Steven Gliebe who <a href="http://wptavern.com/hostingreviews-io-webhosting-reviews-without-the-affliate-links">runs HostingReviews.io</a> and is the founder of <a title="http://churchthemes.com/" href="http://churchthemes.com/">Churchthemes.com</a> has launched the<a href="https://proplugindirectory.com/2015/05/30/launching/"> Pro Plugin Directory</a>. The site lists commercial plugins from a variety of categories including, forms, performance, and security. Its design is based on a modified child theme of <a href="https://array.is/themes/checkout-wordpress-theme/">Checkout by ArrayHQ</a>.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ProPluginDirectory.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-44750" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ProPluginDirectory.png?resize=960%2C609" alt="Pro Plugin Directory Home Page" /></a>Pro Plugin Directory Home Page\n<p>Gliebe created the site because he was frustrated that there was no resource for easily locating commercial WordPress plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of the time I do find what I need in the free directory. Sometimes though, I want to see what the commercial options are,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>After asking several members of the community if such a site already exists, he came up empty. &#8220;I asked around and found that apparently there is no definitive <em>Pro</em> plugin directory as I suspected, so I thought I&#8217;d give it a go. WordPress is 12 years old and it&#8217;s beyond time to establish this.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Monetization Strategy</h2>\n<p>Maintaining a directory can be hard work and without a way to be paid for the effort involved, interest can disappear quickly. Affiliate links are a natural strategy for the site while another is to sell upgraded listings.</p>\n<p>His focus is getting the site established with as many listings as possible. &#8220;Right now, my focus is on building up the site and making it useful. If it proves to be successful in that respect then I&#8217;m sure there will be a reasonable way to turn a profit and take it to the next level,&#8221; Gliebe said.</p>\n<h2>Scalability</h2>\n<p>One of the largest obstacles of running a directory is scalability. In the case of Pro Plugin Directory, the submissions come directly from the plugin sellers. The <a href="https://proplugindirectory.com/submissions/">Submission Guidelines</a> have certain requirements to help ensure quality content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The original content they submit is in a sense their <em>payment</em> for being listed and gaining exposure. There surely is work to be done but it will not be as heavy as <a href="http://themesorter.com/">ThemeSorter</a> or similar failed plugin and theme directory endeavors. I basically click <strong>approve</strong> or <strong>reject</strong> with the way it&#8217;s setup,&#8221; Gliebe said.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SearchWPPluginListing.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-44752" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SearchWPPluginListing.png?resize=1025%2C601" alt="Search WP Plugin Directory Listing" /></a>SearchWP Plugin Directory Listing\n<h2>How Success will be Measured</h2>\n<p>Without monetizing the site up front and being a new resource within the community, Gliebe tells the Tavern what metrics he&#8217;ll use to measure success.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Repeat visitors. If I see that people return to the site to find commercial plugin options then I&#8217;ll know that it is a <em>go-to</em> resource. I would also like to see search engine results for specific types of plugins return the free plugin directory at position number one and a Pro Plugin Directory category at number two, so that the user has a complete picture of his options readily available.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The Directory is Useless Without Plugin Submissions</h2>\n<p>The directory won&#8217;t become what Gliebe envisions unless commercial plugin authors <a href="https://proplugindirectory.com/submissions/">submit their plugins</a>. &#8220;In order for these things to happen, the directory needs plugins. It needs a very wide selection of commercial WordPress plugins. I need the support of plugin authors above all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although Gliebe is encouraged with the number of plugins already submitted to the site, he needs the directory to be the first thing people think of when searching for a commercial option.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it becomes a <em>go-to</em> place for plugin sellers to market their new plugins then it just might work. I figure, if they know about it, why wouldn&#8217;t they list their plugins? It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s easy, and I&#8217;d do it myself before other, harder, marketing tactics.&#8221;</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PluginSubmissionForm.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-44753" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PluginSubmissionForm.png?resize=676%2C734" alt="Pro Plugin Directory Submission Form" /></a>Pro Plugin Directory Submission Form\n<h2>Does it Stand a Chance?</h2>\n<p>Creating a commercial plugin directory is not a new idea. Brad Touesnard founded the WordPress App Store which tried to be a commercial plugin directory while making it easier to browse and buy plugins.

Those who are familiar with <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred</a> for Mac will find many similarities in <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/aladdin/" target="_blank">Aladdin</a>, which was released today by <a href="https://twitter.com/tsiger" target="_blank">Gerasimos Tsiamalos</a> and the folks at <a href="http://www.cssigniter.com/" target="_blank">CSSIgniter</a>.</p>\n<p>Aladdin joins the ranks of <a href="http://wptavern.com/jarvis-a-free-quicksearch-tool-for-the-wordpress-dashboard" target="_blank">Jarvis</a>, <a href="http://wpbutler.com/" target="_blank">WP Butler</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-jump-menu/" target="_blank">WP Jump Menu</a>, and Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/omnisearch/" target="_blank">Omnisearch</a> in the recent proliferation of WordPress admin search tools. The plugin provides a simple keyboard quick launcher for accessing WordPress admin menu items.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aladdin-example.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aladdin-example.png?resize=800%2C600" alt="aladdin-example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44678" /></a></p>\n<p>After installing the plugin, users can launch Aladdin by pressing the <strong>Shift key</strong> twice. Start typing in the search modal until you see the menu option then press enter. Here&#8217;s a quick demo of how it works:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aladdin.gif"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aladdin.gif?resize=797%2C767" alt="aladdin" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44673" /></a></p>\n<h3>How Does Aladdin Compare to Other WordPress Admin Search Tools?</h3>\n<p>Aladdin cannot yet measure up to other admin search tools without adding the capability of searching through content. Tsiamalos posted his plugin in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/962183043843910/" target="_blank">Advanced WordPress users Facebook</a> group this morning, requesting feedback.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of adding auto-complete for user-generated content as well &#8211; Posts, Pages, Post Types etc.,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Initial testers of the plugin were enthusiastic about the interface but could not see a use for it outside of a large website with lots of menus for custom post types and/or a long list of plugins installed. Small, simple blogging sites would not benefit from this tool unless Tsiamalos adds the ability to search for user-generated content. In its current state, it&#8217;s best suited to those who are using WordPress as a CMS.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I initially built it for my local multisite (60+ plus themes to maintain) and I thought others would find it useful, too,&#8221; Tsiamalos told the Tavern. This kind of scenario makes sense for the plugin&#8217;s current capabilities.</p>\n<p>Aladdin&#8217;s interface, with its convenient launch and lightning fast filtering, is the golden feature of this plugin. After testing Aladdin, I believe the tool has a lot of promise, especially once the author expands its capabilities to include content searching. The search modal is currently positioned too low on the page, but that&#8217;s an easy fix. The fact that the modal is always hidden unless summoned is also a bonus.</p>\n<p>The interface for Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/omnisearch/" target="_blank">Omnisearch</a> module cannot compare. While it functions well to search through the admin and content, it requires the user to scroll to the top to type into the admin search bar or visit the dedicated Omnisearch page. Searching redirects you to a cluttered results page that is not convenient to browse.</p>\n<p>Overall, the experience of searching with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jarvis/" target="_blank">Jarvis</a> is simpler and more visually appealing than Aladdin or the Omnisearch module. It searches both admin menu items and user-generated content. It can be launched using the quick key &#8220;/&#8221; or by typing in the admin search bar. The demo below demonstrates how it works:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jarvis-demo.gif"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jarvis-demo.gif?resize=992%2C578" alt="jarvis-demo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44695" /></a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Jarvis hasn&#8217;t been updated in more than year. Similarly, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-butler/" target="_blank">WP Butler</a>, which provides a slightly less polished experience, hasn&#8217;t been updated in more than two years.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-jump-menu/" target="_blank">WP Jump Menu</a> is faster than all of the solutions above, but it doesn&#8217;t include WordPress admin menu items. Its somewhat clunky interface, anchored to the admin search bar, is almost forgivable given its speedy searching capabilities. However, WP Jump Menu is limited to searching user-generated content and isn&#8217;t designed for quickly jumping to admin menu items.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-jump-menu.gif"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-jump-menu.gif?resize=1025%2C521" alt="wp-jump-menu" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44697" /></a></p>\n<h3>WordPress Core Needs a Convenient Admin Search Experience</h3>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/omnisearch/" target="_blank">The Search Initiative</a>, which is currently an inactive feature plugin for WordPress core, essentially <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/15/search-initiative-on-hold/" target="_blank">fell off the map in January 2014</a> after the feature <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-global-admin-search-evolves-to-tackle-bigger-problems" target="_blank">failed to merge into WordPress 3.8 at the end of 2013</a>. The project&#8217;s contributors no longer had time to devote to the plugin and its development has never regained the momentum it had in 2013.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, there&#8217;s no doubt that WordPress users are eager to add some sort of global search capability to the admin. It&#8217;s a feature that helps mitigate the complexity of the admin when many custom post types are active and plugins add in their own menu items. The ability to search both content and menu items is beneficial to new and experienced users alike.</p>\n<p>Responses to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/962183043843910/" target="_blank">Tsiamalos&#8217; post on Aladdin</a> indicate that users are willing to test and help refine any extension that demonstrates a convenient way of solving the admin search problem. Many disparate solutions have cropped up over the past few years and often the plugins&#8217; creators were not aware of the other options before building their own.</p>\n<p>WordPress core improvement projects like the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/omnisearch/" target="_blank">Search Initiative</a> are led by volunteers and are at the mercy of contributors&#8217; available time. That means there is no guarantee that the project will move forward to become a more elegant solution for tackling current issues with searching the admin. As with any open source project, it will take motivated folks to step forward to propose a new path forward.</p>\n<p>Admin search is a complex problem but one many plugin developers have found worthy of pursuit. If reception to the Aladdin plugin is any indication, WordPress users are ready to embrace an easier way of navigating the admin.

It now has more than 30,000 active installs, according to WordPress.org, and the suite of add-on plugins and themes has been very successful.</p>\n<h3>WP Job Manager to be acquired by Automattic</h3>\n<p>As most readers know, <a href="https://poststatus.com/automattic-acquired-woocommerce-woothemes/">WooThemes and WooCommerce were acquired by Automattic</a> in May. Mike joined the other WooThemes employees at <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a>. Automattic has a strict policy that employees cannot have paid side projects, whether client or product work. For Mike to stay at Automattic, he had to figure out what the future of WP Job Manager would be.</p>\n<p>Mike decided to sell WP Job Manager to Automattic after they expressed interest, and they have reached an agreement for a deal. While the terms of the deal are not public and Matt Mullenweg and Mike would not comment on the deal, I&#8217;m able to offer some additional insight based on conversations with others that have knowledge of the situation.</p>\n<h3>Revenue and WP Job Manager ecosystem</h3>\n<p>According to sources, WP Job Manager was bringing in $35,000-$40,000 revenue per month at its peak. I believe that Automattic paid greater than one year of expected income to retain rights to the plugin and paid add-ons.</p>\n<p>In March, Mark Forrester <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2015/03/09/mark-forrester-going-small-to-grow-big/">spoke at WordCamp Cape Town</a> on plugin sales models, where he noted that Mike&#8217;s <a href="https://wpjobmanager.com/add-ons/">add-ons</a> were making around $20,000 per month, a number which has grown considerably since then.</p>\n<p>The move from Gumroad to WooCommerce &#8212; and the addition of a bundle option, were quite successful, it appears. Furthermore, add-on products from third parties helped drive growth to WP Job Manager.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href="https://astoundify.com">Astoundify</a> has two themes that utilize WP Job Manager &#8212; Listify and Jobify &#8212; which gross between $45,000 and $50,000 per month alone. In addition to their themes, they make another $5,000-$7,000 from WP Job Manager related plugins. So Astoundify makes around $55,000 per month on top of the WP Job Manager plugin, and in result drive considerable sales back to WP Job Manager&#8217;s other paid add-ons.</p>\n<p>There are other developers with add-ons and themes for WP Job Manager as well. It&#8217;s a successful ecosystem with a mix of themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>Mike was able to create the product with relatively low support costs as well. He hired two part-time support providers, but otherwise managed development and other tasks himself.</p>\n<p>By all means, WP Job Manager is a ridiculously successful product, especially as a side project. It&#8217;s important to remember that this is not the status-quo, but Mike did an incredible job finding the right market combined with a truly terrific product.</p>\n<h3>Q&amp;A with Mike Jolley and Matt Mullenweg</h3>\n<p>I sent some questions to Mike and both Mike and Matt Mullenweg responded. Here are those questions and answers in full:</p>\n<p><strong>When did the acquisition take place? After WooThemes was acquired, same time?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MJ</strong>: The acquisition of WPJM came after the Woo deal was finalised.</p>\n<p>I had known that an acquisition may be happening, but when this was official and it was revealed that Automattic were the acquirers I wasn’t actually aware of their policies surrounding paid projects. I should have read “Year Without Pants” <img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<p><strong>MM</strong>: We want for everyone at Automattic to be fully focused on our shared business and projects, it’s part of what brings everyone together. We had been aware of WPJM from pretty early in the process and thought it could be a nice complement to the WooCommerce business since its approach was so similar.</p>\n<p><strong>What options did you have for the acquisition? I know A8C [Automattic] doesn’t allow paid side projects, so did a change have to happen for you to stay on with Automattic to work on WooCommerce?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MM</strong>: Anything was an option, including making WPJM free or selling it to a third party, but I’m glad we came to the solution we did. Since WPJM is part of Automattic now there’s no real or perceived conflict to the continuing work on it or revenue from it.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ</strong>: I didn’t want to stop working on WooCommerce. It’s still the project I’m most passionate about and I’m not ready to walk away just yet. Although it was a really tough and emotional decision to make, I feel I made the right decision to part ways with WPJM to continue working on WooCommerce.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you explore other options? Selling to someone else, etc?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MJ</strong>: I looked into a few options before I knew the details of the deal from Automattic, naturally. I thought about offloading it to a developer-friend, making it all free, or doing it full time. Ultimately though, the appeal of working for Automattic, the benefits surrounding that, being able to continue working on WooCommerce and with the people I respect, and the acquisition itself won the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you have any support, dev, or other paid help for managing WPJM?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MJ</strong>: Yes; I’ve had help on the support front from both Bryce Adams and Scott Basgaard whom have done work for me on a freelance basis. They have both been a tremendous help, and crucial given the time I have available. Really thankful to those guys.</p>\n<p>On the development side it’s been largely me, although Bryce and Remi Corson have both built an add-on, again freelance based.</p>\n<p><strong>Will you still be the lead on WPJM development at A8C?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MJ</strong>: This is not yet certain. WooCommerce demands most of my time as team lead so it may be difficult to work on both, however if possible I’d still like to contribute to the project and help where I can. The core project at least is GPL and public on Github so I can definitely see myself contributing there to keep my Github commit streak going.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the third party ecosystem look like on WPJM? Jobify, etc. How many folks have products based on it? How could life change for these products?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MJ</strong>: The 3rd party system for WPJM differs to that of WooCommerce in that I do not sell 3rd party items myself via a marketplace. All 3rd party stuff is external.</p>\n<p>Plugin wise, Smyl.es has a cool field editor, Remi Corson, Tiny Giant Studios and Astoundify have several, and there are a few integrations with other plugins ranging from search to geolocation.</p>\n<p>On the theme front, Jobify (and Listify) by Astoundify are the most prominent. Tiny Giant Studios have a few, I’m aware of some for sale on TemplateMonster (unsure of quality), and then there is one-that-shall-not-be-named on Themeforest which bundles paid add-ons (shame).</p>\n<p>The theme side is diverse. Even though I’m targeting the jobs niche, Listify is a generic listings theme which can list everything, powered by WPJM. There are even also even more-niche themes such as Petsitter and Babysitter themes which customise the plugin further.</p>\n<p>Overall, a lot of things going on in this space. If the plugin grows from a8c involvement (which I hope to see) these developers should benefit from an increased user base. Really glad they chose to back my little project.</p>\n<p><strong>Will the format for sales of WPJM change in the future, under the umbrella of A8C? Will it become free?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MJ</strong>: Short term, things should remain as-is, with Automattic taking over the site, sales, and support. Medium- to long-term I cannot say for certain what will happen, but with more time and resources devoted to it (more than my weekends and evenings) I hope to see the ecosystem grow and support for the plugin to continue.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of revenue was WP Job Manager seeing in the months prior to the acquisition?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MM</strong>: No comment on the economics of the plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>How many paid users do you have?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MM</strong>: Still no comment on the economics of the plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of acquisition occurred? Cash and stock? Cash or stock only?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MM</strong>: Sorry we don’t comment on this.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell me the ballpark of the acquisition value?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MM</strong>: Definitely Astrodome.</p>\n<h3>What we&#8217;ve learned here</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot we can take away from the WP Job Manager acquisition.</p>\n<p>For one, it proves that a single individual can have a massive impact on the WordPress ecosystem. It&#8217;s impossible to deny how influential Mike has been. He&#8217;s the lead developer of the world&#8217;s most popular eCommerce plugin, while he runs an incredible successful job manager plugin on the side.</p>\n<p>His success is astonishingly impressive to me. I&#8217;m quite happy for him and everything he&#8217;s achieved.</p>\n<p>It also appears to me based on discussions that it was not well known that Automattic restricts side projects for their employees. It&#8217;s a long standing policy and I think it works for them; however it does make for certain challenges when they hire self-employed product makers or acquire companies with different policies.</p>\n<p>The acquisition of WooThemes brought a number of challenges. Mike being on board would have been a huge priority for me, if I were acquiring WooThemes. The half a million dollars or more (I am just guessing) to acquire WP Job Manager would be well worth it, even if I didn&#8217;t have big plans for the product.</p>\n<p>That said, I think in this case Automattic could make great use of WP Job Manager. It would be another terrific fit for their WordPress.com VIP clients, and if they actively develop it, it could receive even more adoption long term.</p>\n<p>However, just as I thought with WooCommerce, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they make Mike&#8217;s traditionally paid add-ons free, as paid plugins don&#8217;t particularly jive with Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s historical viewpoints. And WP Job Manager &#8212; while it has quite a bit of potential for a normal person &#8212; doesn&#8217;t likely have the same growth potential as WooCommerce to be an attractive monetization avenue as an Automattic product.</p>\n<p>So I would expect that the plugin model will change over the coming months.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to both Mike and Automattic; this is a win for both parties. Mike is a huge asset to any organization, and I&#8217;m really glad he is able to be financially rewarded for all of his contributions making great WordPress products.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 02 Jun 2015 17:45:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: WPShout Releases New WordPress Plugin that Displays all Image Sizes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=44654";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://wptavern.com/wpshout-releases-new-wordpress-plugin-that-displays-all-image-sizes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2581:"<p>When images are uploaded to the WordPress media library, several different sized images are generated.

Once activated, you&#8217;ll see a list of all sizes of each image in the Add Media modal and in each image&#8217;s individual page in the Media Library.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DisplayAllImageSizesInAction.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-44656" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DisplayAllImageSizesInAction.png?resize=1025%2C519" alt="All Image Sizes and Their URLs" /></a>All Image Sizes and Their URLs\n<p>With the plugin activated, a vertical scroll wheel is added to the attachment details screen. Depending on the size of your monitor,  you may encounter the same thing.</p>\n<p>The scroll bar is annoying, because I commonly use the image sizes in the attachment display settings drop down menu. This requires me to scroll every time I need to access that menu.</p>\n<h2>Ideas for Improvement</h2>\n<p>Instead of showing all image sizes in a blocky manner and vertically stretching the screen, they should be moved to the existing drop down menu where you can select an image&#8217;s size. When a user selects an image size from the menu, the file URL could automatically change to point to that image. This way, the plugin would use native interface elements and make the default attachment details screen more useful.</p>\n<p>Display all image sizes works as advertised with WordPress 4.2.2. If the team improves the user interface and can minimize the screen real-estate it uses, the plugin could turn out to be a very useful addition to sites that use a lot of custom image sizes.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 02 Jun 2015 15:39:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: Matt Mullenweg’s Keynote at WordCamp Dallas 2008";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=44639";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenwegs-keynote-at-wordcamp-dallas-2008";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3206:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordCampDallas2008FeaturedImage.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-44643" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordCampDallas2008FeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200" alt="WordCamp Dallas Featured Image" /></a>Photo courtesy of <a href="http://ma.tt/2008/03/first-day-of-wordcamp/">Matt Mullenweg</a>\n<p>The following is a recording of Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s keynote presentation at WordCamp Dallas 2008. <a href="http://onemansblog.com/2008/04/03/wordcamp-dallas-2008-matt-mullenweg-wordpress-25-and-beyond/">Recorded by John Pozadzides</a> who helped organize the event, it&#8217;s the only video of Mullenweg&#8217;s keynote that exists.

The new Insights tab gives users a bird&#8217;s eye view of posting activity and visitor trends. The Stats panel now displays all-time numbers for posts, views, visitors, and the day the site received the most number of views.</p>\n<p>Insights also calculates the most popular day of the week and the most popular hour based on when the site gets the most views on average.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/insights-all-time-stats.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/insights-all-time-stats.jpg?resize=667%2C362" alt="insights-all-time-stats" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44604" /></a></p>\n<p>Posting Activity is another new addition that provides a way to visualize how often you are publishing. The feature is reminiscent of GitHub&#8217;s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile-page/#viewing-contributions-from-specific-times" target="_blank">Contributions calendar</a>, which makes it easy to view contributions from specific times. Insights allows you to mouse over a specific date with a color marker to see how many posts were published that day.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/insights-posting-activity.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/insights-posting-activity.jpg?resize=658%2C256" alt="insights-posting-activity" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44615" /></a></p>\n<p>If, for some reason, you&#8217;re missing the old version of WordPress.com&#8217;s stats, it is available for a limited time under <a href="https://wordpress.com/my-stats/" target="_blank">wordpress.com/my-stats/</a>.</p>\n<p>Insights is not yet available on WordPress mobile apps but will likely be added soon. When asked when Insights will be available to self-hosted users, WordPress.com representative Jonathan Sadowski replied, &#8220;If you install Jetpack and enable the Stats module, you’ll be able to view these stats on WordPress.com for your .org blog.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Stats is arguably one of the most popular features in Jetpack and a major factor for many in the decision to connect with WordPress.com. However, the view from inside the self-hosted Jetpack stats panel is starting to look a little dated when compared to the mobile apps or WordPress.com. Adding Insights to Jetpack&#8217;s stats panel would save users a trip over to WordPress.com to discover this information.</p>\n<p>Most people don&#8217;t have the time or motivation to log into Google Analytics and create a meaningful interpretation of that data to improve their publishing habits. The new and improved stats with Insights offers a better understanding of when you&#8217;re posting and even interprets your traffic to provide actionable data, such as what hour might be the best for scheduling a post, what months lend you the most time to commit to blogging, etc.</p>\n<p>The all-time stats also make it easier to track your blogging progress and set milestones for increasing posts, views, and visitors, and ultimately beating your best traffic day on record. The new feature is <a href="https://wordpress.com/stats/insights" target="_blank">live on WordPress.com</a> today and we&#8217;ll be watching for it in future updates to the mobile apps.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 01 Jun 2015 22:07:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Sergej Müller, Creator of Antispam Bee, Says Goodbye to WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=44567";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://wptavern.com/sergej-muller-creator-of-antispam-bee-says-goodbye-to-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4847:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sergej-Müller.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sergej-Müller.jpg?resize=250%2C382" alt="Sergej-Müller" class="alignright size-full wp-image-44590" /></a>Sergej Müller is <a href="https://gist.github.com/sergejmueller/bccd658a5cdeb5b57deb" target="_blank">saying goodbye to WordPress</a> after nine years and nearly three million downloads of his <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/sergejmueller/#content-plugins" target="_blank">free plugins</a>. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/antispam-bee/" target="_blank">Antispam Bee</a>, his most popular contribution, is currently in use on more than 200,000 WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>Müller penned a <a href="https://gist.github.com/sergejmueller/bccd658a5cdeb5b57deb" target="_blank">farewell</a> Gist on GitHub in his native German, which <a href="http://glueckpress.com/" target="_blank">Caspar Hübinger</a> was kind enough to <a href="https://gist.github.com/glueckpress/ed370acc556c475c3be5" target="_blank">translate</a> into English.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, a chapter of my life is coming to an end. A chapter that has brought an abundance of experience, learning, and fun. A chapter that, on the other hand, demanded a lot of time, nerves, and motivation. But where there’s a will, there’s a way, and I deeply hope my software and my commitment may have made the WordPress community a bit better in terms of quality.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Müller is discontinuing his WordPress contributions due to health reasons, but he plans to find a suitable successor who will be able to deliver the level of quality and support that his users have come to expect. His plugins, most notably <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/antispam-bee/" target="_blank">Antispam Bee</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cachify/" target="_blank">Cachify</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/statify/" target="_blank">Statify</a>, <a href="https://wpseo.de/" target="_blank">wpSEO</a> and <a href="https://optimus.io/" target="_blank">Optimus</a>, are used widely around the world, particularly throughout Germany, Austria, and the germanophone parts of Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Hübinger, who is active in the German and European WordPress communities, has been using Müller&#8217;s plugins for the past six years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just as valuable for me personally were his blog posts and tutorials,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I pretty much learned WordPress development from his blog, and <a href="http://bueltge.de/" target="_blank">Frank Bueltge</a>&#8216;s.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a lot of comments expressing great surprise. No one saw him quitting, obviously. Sergej has been a key figure of the German-speaking WordPress community for the last nine years. While not quite so popular beyond the Germanophone context, I think his note that almost every WordPress user over here has heard of or uses at least one of his plugins is no exaggeration.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Müller does have a couple commercial plugins available, he has never made a living from them. For the past nine years he has been working as a software engineer outside of WordPress. Anyone aspiring to adopt his plugins will need to meet the high standards that he has set in terms of quality and support, especially in regards to supporting the German community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Monika Thon-Soun, a WordPress veteran from Austria, <a href="http://www.texto.de/sergej-einfach-danke-fuer-alles-2192/" target="_blank">mentions</a> she doesn’t remember a single instance where one of Sergej’s plugins would have been hacked,&#8221; Hübinger said. &#8220;Given the popularity of his plugins, that’s truly worth mentioning, as it underlines a character feature that everyone loves him for: reliability.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Müller&#8217;s plugin contributions have always been a hobby for him but he is no longer able to sustain their development and support. He is currently in conversations with parties who are interested in his projects and will announce the new maintainers once it has been finalized.</p>\n<p>Sergej Müller&#8217;s contributions signify the importance of having WordPress extensions and tutorials available for users to learn WordPress in their own language. His role in cultivating the German development community and supporting its many users will not be easily filled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a friend, I understand and support his decision completely,&#8221; Hübinger said. &#8220;As a WordPress user, it’s&#8230;a catastrophe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whoever follows him on G+ will have seen occasional moments of disappointment. In those moments, you could see all his passion. Because it really wasn’t about money for him. Acknowledgement and paying it forward is his favorite currency.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 01 Jun 2015 17:11:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: Beethoven, Mozart, Bach";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45099";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://ma.tt/2015/05/beethoven-mozart-bach/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:238:"<blockquote><p>Beethoven tells you what it&#8217;s like to be Beethoven and Mozart tells you what it&#8217;s like to be human.

Think of it like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IC8VF10/">Shackleton&#8217;s Voyage</a> (a great recommendation from <a href="http://toni.org/">Toni</a>) but on Mars. I really enjoyed the book, and if you like geeky, science-filled novels you will too.  One thing about the publishing I thought was really cool, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)">the Wikipedia puts it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having been rebuffed by literary agents when trying to get prior books published, Weir decided to put the book online in serial format one chapter at a time for free at his website. At the request of fans he made an Amazon Kindle version available through Amazon.com at 99 cents (the minimum he could set the price). The Kindle edition rose to the top of Amazon&#8217;s list of best-selling science-fiction titles, where it sold 35,000 copies in three months, more than had previously downloaded it for free. This garnered the attention of publishers: Podium Publishing, an audiobook publisher, signed for the audiobook rights in January 2013.

We <a href="http://wptavern.com/cloudup-makes-file-sharing-incredibly-easy">discussed the concept</a> in early 2014 and readers were concerned about owning their data.</p>\n<p>Two years later, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2014/04/smith/">WordPress media library and the visual post editor</a> have received major improvements while integration with Cloudup is non-existent. When Matt Mullenweg was asked about the integration in a <a href="http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-194-celebrating-wordpress-12th-birthday-with-matt-mullenweg">recent interview</a>, he responded,</p>\n<blockquote><p>We did a lot of really awesome UI improvements to the editor and did some things we were very excited about, but because we weren&#8217;t working on a TinyMCE base, some of the basic editing stuff was really difficult.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team spent about six months to complete the first 80% of the project then spent a year and a half to reach 85%. Setbacks included a lot of rabbit holes and hidden complexity.

The Senate needs 60 votes in order to provide an extension or renew the provisions past June 1st. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_summary_of_the_Patriot_Act,_Title_II#Section_215:_Access_to_records_and_other_items_under_FISA" target="_blank">Section 215</a> of the measure is particularly controversial in that it allows the National Security Agency (NSA) to collect data from Americans&#8217; phone records.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a> is leading an internet campaign wherein 14,000+ websites will be blocking access to Congress&#8217; IP addresses, redirecting that traffic to the <a href="https://www.blackoutcongress.org/" target="_blank">blackout protest page</a> where they will see the following message:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You have conducted mass surveillance of everyone illegally and are now on record for trying to enact those programs into law. You have presented Americans with the false dichotomy of reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act or passing the USA Freedom Act. The real answer is to end all authorities used to conduct mass surveillance. Until you do, thousands of web sites have blocked your access, and more are joining every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The campaign is coordinated by the <a href="https://www.internetdefenseleague.org/" target="_blank">Internet Defense League</a>, an organization that has been instrumental in <a href="http://wptavern.com/join-the-september-10th-internet-slowdown-protest-with-these-wordpress-plugins" target="_blank">defending net neutrality</a> and protesting the SOPA/PIPA censorship bills.</p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress site owners who want to participate in protesting the renewal of the Patriot Act can install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cat-signal/" target="_blank">Internet Defense League Cat Signal</a> plugin from WordPress.org. It includes the blackout script as well as a dismissable notice to site visitors, asking them to <a href="https://www.sunsetthepatriotact.com/" target="_blank">urge Congress to sunset the Patriot Act</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cat-signal-modal.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cat-signal-modal.jpg?resize=749%2C426" alt="cat-signal-modal" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44519" /></a></p>\n<p>The Cat Signal plugin will link your site up to the Internet Defense League&#8217;s online activist group. When an important bill is up for action, it will automatically enqueue the JavaScript required to post a notice on your site. It also includes an options page for selecting the pages where it should be active and for setting the notice as a banner or a modal.</p>\n<p>If sunsetting the Patriot Act is important to you, the Cat Signal plugin is the easiest way to get your WordPress site into the protest.

They drive Qualcomm’s participation in more than 150 standards bodies and industry organizations.\r\n\r\nStandards representatives promote Qualcomm’s technology and interests while facing representatives of many other companies promoting their own interests of their companies. Not only standardization helps use promote own technologies but allows us to understand the industry and build relationships to further our strategic objectives.\r\n\r\nQSIO helps influence the roadmaps for products and works with the implementation teams to ensure that our products conform to the myriad of existing standards and specifications.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h4>Role of Standards</h4>\r\nStandardization moves the industry forward to do things in a common way. Companies meet in standards bodies or industry groups to determine the best path forward for the industry as a whole.\r\n\r\nQualcomm is a company of inventors, with unparalleled R&amp;D programs. One could think of Qualcomm Standards as the sales arm of our patents. This drives our licensing business – which provides a tremendous, high-margin revenue stream to the company.\r\n\r\nStandards are equally essential for our products business centered around modems, Automotive, M2M, Connected Health and others. Standards team efforts extend beyond cellular into emerging areas that are future growth drivers for Qualcomm, including machine-to-machine communications, wireless health, connected home, smart automotive, wireless charging, and many more[wpex more="..." less="."]\r\n\r\nStandards represent the primary mechanism through which Qualcomm commercializes its technology and IP.

The purpose of oneM2M is to develop technical specifications that address the need for a M2M communication and data sharing platform for the cloud. This platform is called the M2M Service Layer and can be readily embedded within various hardware and software and relied upon to connect the large number of devices in the field with M2M application servers worldwide[wpex more="..." less="."]\r\n\r\nA critical objective of oneM2M is to attract and actively involve organizations from M2M-related business domains including telematics and intelligent transportation, healthcare, utilities, industrial automation, and smart homes. The M2M Service Layer is typically implemented as software that runs on a wide variety of things in the IoE like temperature sensors, door locks, TVs, air-conditioners, cars, smart homes, routers, and up to large computers in the cloud.\r\n\r\nThis software is like an operating system specially made for sensors/actors/machines/things that need to talk to each other. This software controls when it is OK to use communication networks to send or receive data, connects sensors/actors and the cloud in a secure manner, hides the complexity of setting up various network connections, avoids congestions and costly use of communication links, and supports sharing of data such that only those who are authorized can access or influence information in sensors/actors/machines/things.\r\n\r\nThe M2M Service Layer specified by oneM2M provides M2M/IoT communications and data sharing functions that are typically needed across a number of industry segments. It is often called a horizontal M2M service layer. This standard may become a key enabler for larger scale M2M/IoT deployments across a number of different industry segments, enabling Qualcomm to develop products that could be sold into various industry segments without the need for vertical-specific product specializations.[/wpex][/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][text-with-icon icon_type="font_icon" icon="icon-envelope-alt" color="Extra-Color-1"]\r\n<h4>oneM2M</h4>\r\nAn increasing number of new industry organizations, consortia, alliances, and standards bodies formed in the area of M2M/IoT.

Everyone in the room stopped talking and listened to the noise, which sounded like some flow of liquid dropping into a bucket.[wpex more=".." less=""] After people realized that the restrooms were within coverage range of the wireless mic system, the whole room started to laugh very hard.

When I left Singapore, we heard that a 7.0 earthquake had hit Japan. I thought, “I’m glad that I left now.” My flight from Singapore back home had a connection through Tokyo. We were on the approach to the runway when the tsunami hit. We had to pull up fast. We circled for about an hour and a half. The captain said it[wpex more="..." less=""] was total chaos on the ground in the tower. They eventually diverted us to Nagoya, but since United didn’t have a hub there, they left us on the tarmac for six more hours. While the captain was waiting for further instructions, I pulled out my laptop which had an EV-DO card in it to find out what was going on. The captain saw the pictures that I was pulling up and he said, “That’s it! We are getting fuel and flying to Inchon, Korea.” So, we did. We landed in at midnight. We ate all the food except for pretzels and water on the trip from Singapore, so everyone was hungry. When we got to the hotel in Korea, they had chefs and staff cooking for us so that we could eat dinner at 1 a.m. We flew home the next afternoon.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h4>Don’t worry, he’s happy</h4>\r\nWhen you work in standards, you occasionally meet famous people on flights or in hotels.  I once flew on the same flight with Justice Antonin Scalia of the US Supreme Court.  But most memorable for me was an encounter with Bobby McFerrin, the musician, and the author of a hit song “Don’t Worry, Be Happy”. Just about everybody knows that song. Not everybody knows what Bobby McFerrin looks like. Neither did I really, I was not so much familiar with his look as I was with his[wpex more="..." less=""] opus. I knew, for example, that he uses his own body as a percussion instrument, for example by tapping his fingers on his chest.  That was the main clue for me to recognize him in the elevator of a Philadelphia hotel. I turned and asked him: “Are you Bobby McFerrin?” to which he replied affirmatively. We then chatted briefly and I learned that he was going to perform in a concert that evening. I decided to attend the concert, where, it turned out, Bobby was directing a version of Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess,” not performing pop songs that made him famous. I still enjoyed the performance very much.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h4>When we had to run out the clock</h4>\r\nDuring the Standards War to get CDMA to prevail in the ITU, that’s the International Telecommunications Union, OK, we had two week-long meetings to develop 3G. You’d get the weekends off, but it was really a long thing. And, the bad guys were really killing us. It was war every day and we were using every trick in the book. They wanted us to do some things that, if we had done it their way, it would have been really bad. I remember, so, basically, they wanted us to give in[wpex more="..." less=""] to what they wanted, and they promised that at the next meeting, they would give in to what we wanted, but no guarantee. So, I called Irwin [Jacobs]. And I said, “This is what these guys want to do.” He said, “Well, there’s no guarantee. And once, they have what they want, they may never give us what we want. So, you can’t give in. You must fight them until Friday, when the meeting ends.” So, our allies and I worked together, and when the opposition came to us with a proposition, we would say, “We’re going to go away and have a private meeting ourselves and talk about, and we’ll let you know. We’ll call back to the States and we’ll see if our management agrees to this.” We knew, because Irwin told us not to do it, that we would never give in. So we went to our little back room, ostensibly, to consider the proposition that was offered at that time. The proposition was getting better and better as the week went on, but what we did was, we just played cards. Our management had said, “We can’t give in. If we give in, then we’ll lose because they’ll never give us what we want at our next meeting.” They would have won and CDMA would’ve lost.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_gallery type="nectarslider_style" interval="3" layout="3" gallery_style="1" onclick="link_no" custom_links_target="_self" images="193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200" img_size="603x603"][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_gallery type="nectarslider_style" interval="3" layout="3" gallery_style="1" onclick="link_no" custom_links_target="_self" images="222,223,224,225,226,227,221" img_size="603x603"][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner class="nonattributed"][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>You know you are a standards person when</h3>\r\n[/vc_column_text][testimonial_slider autorotate="8000"][testimonial title="Testimonial" id="1426875499-1-23" quote="You have a large bag of unusable coins from countries around the world.``\r\n\r\n``You need to be awake to attend a standards meeting at 3 a.m., but be back at the office, at work at 9 a.m. and function for your remaining nonstandard work responsibilities.``\r\n\r\n``You know the best and worst seats on every airplane type flown by three or more airlines." name=" "] Click the edit button to add your testimonial.

But long term, even after some failures, staying true to technical and market needs and governing oneself publicly in accordance to those principles, eventually builds trust and helps in future projects.[/wpex][/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][text-with-icon icon_type="font_icon" icon="icon-facetime-video" color="Extra-Color-1"]\r\n<h4>You’ve got to persuade the competition</h4>\r\nMost decisions in standards are consensus-based, so it is sometimes hard work to get people convinced to adopt a particular proposal.

When it works, it’s a lot of fun.

Our initial solution transferred vehicle accident related data (vehicle location, identity, crash related sensor data) using an inband modem (sharing the voice path) over an automated emergency call from a vehicle to a PSAP. The QSIO inband solution was chosen by 3GPP and is mandated for deployment in new vehicles in the EU by 2018. In 2014, QSIO lead a task force in ETSI to define a Next Generation (NG) version of eCall based on LTE access [wpex more="..." less=""] and IMS in which vehicle data transfer would occur via IMS signaling and not over the voice path. We are also driving this in the IETF. We are adding the ETSI NG solution into 3GPP specs to enable EU operators to migrate from the inband solution as they deploy LTE and IMS. The NG solution further augments QCT’s leading product position in the vehicle communications market.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>E911 over LTE, WLAN and with Multi Media</h3>\r\nQSIO is an active contributor in 3GPP to standards that enable emergency calls to be made over an LTE access using IMS. The initial solution in 3GPP 5 years ago supported voice calls (VoLTE) and is deployed in our products and in networks all over the world by numerous operators. Support of additional media (text, video, IM) was added by 3GPP around 3 years ago and should be deployed by US operators and supported in our products over the next few years. 3GPP is now studying VoWLAN access at the behest of many US and EU operators, and QSIO is a leading contributor. In addition, QSIO is active in IETF, with regional SDOs in the EU (EENA, ETSI) and China (CCSA, TIAA) [wpex more="..." less=""] and with vehicle telematics providers (Onstar, Verizon Telematics) to enable Next Generation IMS-based E911 solutions to evolve and support a panoply of emergency related services including eCall, mHealth, personal emergency calls, human language negotiation, all using a common IMS solution in carriers. Such a wide variety of services should enhance the attraction and competitiveness of Qualcomm products in all world regions.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Locating emergency callers indoors - multi SDO Work and Study Items</h3>\r\nQSIO is active in several SDOs and in partnership with carriers and other vendors to create and enhance wireless standards to locate emergency callers indoors with unprecedented accuracy. We played a major role in creating agreement between the industry, public safety and the FCC on feasible targets for location accuracy that include a horizontal accuracy of 50 meters and an ability to provide an exact street address including floor level, and in some cases room or apartment identity.[wpex more=".." less=""] We are a leading participant in 3GPP in defining and evaluating indoor positioning solutions that will meet the FCC targets, including OTDOA, WiFi, Bluetooth and barometric pressure. We are also leading in ATIS in creating new North America specific standards that will meet the FCC mandated targets for indoor location accuracy over the next 8 years. Most of the solutions being pursued by us and the industry are already partly supported in our products and play to Qualcomm’s strengths in the area of accurate and reliable location.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>In-Location Alliance (ILA)</h3>\r\nQSIO was a founding member of the In-Location Alliance (ILA) and has been pivotal in helping transform ILA into a global standards related organization now comprising around 70 members whose objective is to create an architecture and set of associated standards to support accurate location of mobile devices inside buildings, venues and other indoor structures. While ILA does not itself write standards, it serves as a focal point for helping other standards bodies (e.g., OMA, IEEE, BT SIG) create applicable standards and has created its own architectural model that a venue owner or operator can use to support indoor location.[wpex more=".." less=""] This model and the associated standards follow Qualcomm preferences and were largely introduced by us. At the moment, ILA is more useful to Qualcomm as a PR tool for our proprietary location solutions. Standards work in ILA has slowed due to uncertainties within the industry as to how accurate indoor location should best evolve. However, if standards solutions regain prominence (e.g., as a consequence of the FCC mandate on indoor E911 location), we and ILA will be in a position to quickly roll out a standard solution.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="center center" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="light" text_align="left" top_padding="8%" id="spectrumengineering" parallax_bg="true" bottom_padding="3%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Spectrum Engineering</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="3%" bottom_padding="5%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]In the quest to solve the 1000x mobile data challenge, spectrum is an important building block. Given that spectrum is a finite resource, the industry is hard at work to utilize the available spectrum in the most efficient manner and to identify opportunities to open more spectrum for mobile data. To achieve these goals in support of Qualcomm’s business strategies, the Spectrum Engineering team performs technical analysis and attends relevant regional/international regulatory groups and SDOs to present the result of our studies and to defend Qualcomm’s positions. We target both licensed spectrum for exclusive use by mobile systems such as LTE and future 5th Generation and unlicensed spectrum for shared used by wireless systems such as WiFi and LTE-U. In addition, we work to unlock government spectrum, which is partially occupied, based on Licensed Shared Access for shared licensed use by mobile systems. Our team closely works with relevant QSIO/QCT/GA teams for a tight inter-company coordination.\r\n<h3>New spectrum resources for mobile broadband IMT/LTE</h3>\r\nWe are active in global efforts to identify and open new spectrum for mobile broadband. An essential requirement in these efforts is to assist global harmonization of candidate bands in the interest of Qualcomm’s business.\r\n<h3>China</h3>\r\n[wpex more="" less=""]We worked in several regions jointly with other companies on opening the band 3400-3600 MHz for IMT/LTE. Our current aim is to open this band in China by participating in the CCSA coexistence studies between IMT and the incumbent Fixed Satellite Systems (FSS). Since 2008, we have actively participated in the CCSA studies on band plan for 450-4570 MHz. We assist the Chinese government in coexistence studies between IMT and incumbent services (railway trunking system, broadcast system, radio location) in co-channel and adjacent bands deployment scenarios and promote the globally harmonized IMT FDD allocation as the band plan for China. We also work on 3300-3400 MHz, 4400-4500 MHz and 4800-4890 MHz bands, which are new spectrum supported by China for IMT.\r\n\r\n[/wpex]\r\n<h3>Japan</h3>\r\n[wpex more="" less=""]Japan’s focus is to open the IMT band for Mobile Satellite Systems (MSS), Downlink: 2170 - 2200 MHz/Uplink: 1980 - 2010 MHz, for terrestrial use. Qualcomm proposed a terrestrial/satellite hybrid system in response to the MIC’s call for proposals in 2013. Softbank Mobile adopted xHRPD (the satellite component in Qualcomm’s hybrid system proposal) as their proposed system and started to work with MIC to acquire this spectrum. We aim to work with Softbank to open the band for terrestrial use.[/wpex]\r\n<h3>Europe</h3>\r\n[wpex more="" less=""]In Europe, we led the technical work in CEPT/ITU-R Joint Task Group (JTG) on Agenda Item 1.2 of WRC 2015 for clearing the UHF 700 MHz TV band for IMT/LTE operation. This defines limits for out-of-band (OOB) emissions caused by LTE UE transmitters in this band to the Digital TV devices receiving below the band. The limits meet QCT requirements and allow a single device implementation based on 3GPP LTE Band 28 for operation in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.[/wpex]\r\n<h3>Promotion of Licensed Shared Access (LSA) concept</h3>\r\nWe are actively involved in Qualcomm’s effort to promote LSA concept as a means for opening additional globally harmonized licensed spectrum for mobile data. Based on our initiative, the Japanese MIC included LSA in its Spectrum Strategy Report as one of technologies for spectrum sharing in the middle term. In China, we contributed to the CCSA LSA work and are currently involved in the CCSA efforts to publish a white paper on LSA. In cooperation with Qualcomm’s standardization and GA teams in Europe, we were successful in opening the 2.3 GHz in several CEPT countries for LTE operation on an LSA basis.\r\n<h3>Spectrum for 5G</h3>\r\nWe started work on spectrum for the 5<sup>th</sup> Generation (5G) of mobile communications systems by participating in the regulatory groups of different regions and also in the spectrum project of NGMN with a goal of more and better global harmonized spectrum.\r\n\r\nIn China, CCSA has launched 5G studies addressing requirements, candidate technologies, and spectrum needs. CCSA will act as external interface for the China IMT-2020 Promotion Group (PG) to international (e.g., ITU-R/3GPP) and regional (e.g., CJK/EU) SDOs.\r\n<h3>New spectrum in 5 GHz band for Wireless Access Systems (WAS) including WLANs</h3>\r\nWe are active in global efforts on 5 GHz band expansion for WAS including WLANs to promote Qualcomm''s strategy respecting Wi-Fi, LTE-LAA, and DSRC businesses. In Japan, our suggestions were accepted at a Technical Study Group of MIC that is investigating new spectrum for WLAN in 5 GHz. We are involved in similar efforts in the US, Europe, and China. In collaboration with NTIA, Cisco, Intel, and Broadcom, our Spectrum Engineering team developed a software tool to analyze WLANs coexistence with radars for providing contributions to ITU-R, the US-JTG, and CEPT groups CPG PTD and SE24.\r\n<h3>Regulations for 60 GHz (IEEE 802.11ad)</h3>\r\nWe are working on new regulations for 60 GHz in Japan. As of April 2015, the conducted output power is limited to 10 mW, much lower than the limit allowed in other countries. This puts considerable restrictions on the IEEE 802.11ad operation in Japan. MIC created a committee to discuss new 60 GHz regulations for Japan. Qualcomm gained support for much higher power for devices in 60 GHz. It was agreed to increase the conducted output power to 250 mW (10 dBi or more antenna gain is required when more than 10 mW is used). The discussions on the Rx spurious emission limits are ongoing.\r\n<h3>Sub-GHz unlicensed spectrum for 80.11ah</h3>\r\nWe are leading studies in Europe and China on technical conditions for the operation of 801.11ah in the sub-GHz band. In Europe, we created at CEPT ECC a Work Item for studies on coexistence between 802.11ah based Wideband Short Range Devices (SRDs) and other SRDs in the band 870-876 MHz/915-921 MHz. We are driving these studies and targeting the finalization of work in mid-2015.\r\n\r\nSince 2013, we have studied with China 801.11ah spectrum needs and proposed 900 MHz as the target spectrum according to analysis of Chinese spectrum allocation and global 11ah spectrum status. We are performing spectrum predictions to justify the need for 5 MHz spectrum for 802.11ah in 920-925 MHz and are performing coexistence studies to address interference concerns of incumbents.\r\n<h3>Spectrum for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)/V2X (Vehicle to Vehicle/Infrastructure)</h3>\r\nSince 2015, we have started seeking some dedicated spectrum for V2X safety application in China. We have joined the work on spectrum demand prediction, as well as the coexistence studies between 802.11p / LTE based V2X technology and incumbent services in the targeted bands and adjacent bands.\r\n<h3>3GPP back-office technical work</h3>\r\nWe support Qualcomm’s 3GPP RAN4 team by performing interference analysis and coexistence studies between 3GPP systems deployments in adjacent bands and between such systems and other services in adjacent bands.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="center center" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="light" text_align="left" top_padding="8%" id="regionalupdate" parallax_bg="true" bottom_padding="3%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Regional Update</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="5%" bottom_padding="5%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>China</h3>\r\n<h4>LTE</h4>\r\nThe LTE TDD network rapidly deployed after the Chinese government formally issued LTE TDD licenses to all three operators in December 2013. By the end of 2014, CMCC had deployed nationwide 700K LTE TDD eNB, and domestic 4G subscribers reached 80 million. CT and CU were granted FDD licenses in February 2015, one year after an FDD/TDD hybrid network trial, and rolled out LTE service in more than 50 cities. Qualcomm is driving a multi-SIM, multimode solution and standardization to support the explosively growing LTE smartphone market despite fierce competition.\r\n<h4>5G</h4>\r\nChina’s 2015 focus switched from academic research to industry promotion. Led by the National High-Tech Project[wpex more="..." less=""] (863-5G project), China aims to play a more influential role in 5G, with academia and industry researching 5G candidate technologies and system architecture. Qualcomm is establishing a 5G leadership position by participating in all related 5G activities in the FuTURE Forum and CCSA, and giving keynote speeches in the most influential 5G summits.\r\n<h4>Spectrum</h4>\r\nChinese regulators are responding to the industry’s demand for spectrum. Qualcomm is taking advantage of the opportunity to influence China spectrum planning and seeking more global harmonized spectrum for IMT and other new services that Qualcomm is promoting, such as WPT, V2X and 802.11ah.\r\n<h4>Automotive</h4>\r\nTelematics and ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) have received widespread attention in China. Several industry alliances were established by the government and industries to pursue urgently needed standardization and solutions from various perspectives such as V2V, V2I, emergency and maintenance service, etc. Qualcomm is coordinating the efforts in CCSA, TIAA, and C-ITS to achieve a unified solution acceptable for all interested ministries and virtual industries.\r\n<h4>Internet of Things (IoT)</h4>\r\nIn the IoT realm, Smart homes, e-Health/m-Health, and Industry 4.0 attract interest. Qualcomm is actively involved in eUICC and smart wearables standardization, 11ah and oneM2M Rel.1 transpositions in CCSA, and promoting AllJoyn.\r\n<h4>Wireless charging</h4>\r\nChina Regulator, Government Research and Test Forces, and pioneer handset vendors show increasing interest in wireless charging technologies. However many of them are more familiar with the first-generation technology from WPC. QSIO made multiple introductions and promotions of A4WP and its technical work to CCSA and CATR. Qualcomm is also driving WPT spectrum study in China to ensure the best legality of using 6.78 MHz for A4WP/WiPower™.\r\n<h4>Standards reform</h4>\r\nThe Chinese central government is driving standards reform, with an aim to diminish recommended industry standards and encourage consortia to develop standards based on market needs and technical progress. Standards development gradually move to industry alliance and associations, which will give Qualcomm more flexibility and opportunities to bring advanced technologies and products into the China market.\r\n\r\n[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Korea</h3>\r\n<h4>5G</h4>\r\nKorean OEMs and operators are interested in 5G deployment. The 5G Forum and Korean industry are focused on the mmWave channel model, 5G evaluation methodology, and 5G system architecture. The government will have a trial service in PyeongChang in 2018. Leveraging a strong technology position will help Qualcomm negotiate 5G licensing with OEMs.\r\n<h4>Wireless Power Transmission (WPT)</h4>\r\nQSIO is leading WPT in Korea. CJK, WPT, and ITU-R WP1A organized a new group to evaluate the value of WPT technologies. To harmonize operating frequency, it will be helpful for OEMs to get Qualcomm solutions, such as A4WP and Halo™. Samsung announced S6 will adopt the (non-Qualcomm) Qi (WPC) solution, but LGE is interested in A4WP.\r\n\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Japan</h3>\r\n<h4>2020 Tokyo Olympic Games</h4>\r\nThe current buzz in Japan is about the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is promoting various types of new advanced wireless technologies and revising the spectrum policies with an eye towards 2020. Future plans for 5G promotion/trial and other upcoming technologies are being undertaken.\r\n<h4>Fifth Generation Mobile Communications Promotion Forum</h4>\r\nThe Fifth Generation Mobile Communications Promotion Forum (5GMF) was established in September 2014 by telecom companies, academic experts, ARIB, TTC, and MIC. 5GMF promotes research and development of 5G and[wpex more="..." less=""] foresees international collaborations. Qualcomm covers all 5GMF committees. MIC is working on technology rules and spectrum policies on advanced LTE technologies, 5 GHz technologies, and 60 GHz technologies. Qualcomm is a member of those WGs.\r\n<h4>WPT</h4>\r\nJapan’s WPT spectrum harmonization strategy is mostly aligned with WiPower and Halo. Qualcomm is a member of MIC WPT-WG. Qualcomm leads the Japanese delegates at ITU-R WP 1A and APT.\r\n\r\n[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>India</h3>\r\nCreation of TSDSI, India’s SDO, initiated technical coordination among organizations with business interests in India. TSDSI created a group on 5G standardization, focusing on requirement collection. Delegates to TSDSI established Qualcomm as a technology leader and are participating in its activities.\r\n<h4>4G</h4>\r\nBy the end of 2015, pan-India 4G networks will have rolled out. This is likely to bring deployment challenges, especially around Band 40. The India BD team is also looking to diversify on topics outside of our traditional modem space.\r\n<h4>Spectrum</h4>\r\nDoT concluded its spectrum auction. Bands in 800, 900, 1800, and 1900 were up for auction, and MNOs aggressively[wpex more="..." less="."] participated in the process This paves way to improve Qualcomm’s business in the 3G and 4G evolution space.\r\n<h4>White space</h4>\r\nQualcomm is participating in white space-related discussions in India.\r\n<h4> Future growth</h4>\r\nIndia is promoting the Made in India initiative to enhance local manufacturing. Considerable investment in the telecom space is expected. Many European and Asian companies have committed to invest in telecom research and development and manufacturing in India.\r\n\r\n[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="center center" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="light" text_align="left" top_padding="8%" id="testandcertification" parallax_bg="true" bottom_padding="3%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Test &amp; Certification</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="5%" bottom_padding="5%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Qualcomm validation of industry test cases</h3>\r\nOperating closely with industry test houses, Qualcomm is one of the main providers of mobile test platforms.

The HDMI 2.0 specification was applied to feature development of the Qualcomm MSM8996 which required an HDMI 2.0 Transmitter. Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA), part of 3D audio processing, is a Qualcomm developed audio format that should be adopted by the HDMI 2.1 new audio formats under the MPEG-H heading.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>VESA Display Stream Compression</h3>\r\nOur VESA Display Stream Compression (DSC) team is designing and implementing a new compression protocol for all future Qualcomm AP display processing engines. This DSC standard has been adopted by VESA eDP, DP and all MIPI DSI interfaces and is widely deployed both on the AP and customer display driver IC side. Standardization of the VESA DSC encoder and decoder compression protocol assures display vendors their high-volume, cost sensitive products will work immediately with Qualcomm processors without the expense of custom certification.  This allows Qualcomm access to the broadest set of display partners in the industry. The next generation VESA DSC mobile will be in all Qualcomm Hoya products and beyond and will offer increased 4:1 compression for 4K 60 Hz displays, improved visually lossless quality, reduced decoder area and improved system-level cost savings for the BOM.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Setting the bar higher for mobile display</h3>\r\nQualcomm is at the forefront of 4K mobile video. Competitive pressure from MediaTek pushes frame rates up to 120 Hz. The SMPTE broadcast standard is pushing the high-dynamic range (HDR) requirements for television with increased pixel depth ranging from 10 bits up to 16 bits per pixel. These standards call for display bandwidth to quadruple within the next two to three years. SMPTE/HDMI and EBU are contemplating the introduction of 8K 120Hz resolution in time for the Tokyo Olympics at the end of the decade. If this format gains traction, next generation displays will require 16x more bandwidth than 4K 60Hz 10-bit does today.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Embedded Multi-Media Controller</h3>\r\nWe added sophisticated features to eMMC to improve performance, reduce power, and enhance security.

A principal engineer with QSIO Germany, Blanz leads Qualcomm’s Machine-to-Machine Communication/Internet of Things (M2M/IoT) Standards project.\r\n\r\nHis work focuses on the best way to get all sorts of machines and things connected to one another and to the Cloud. At the same time, he looks to keep communications resource-efficient and to allow simple use of network connectivity by application and product developers.\r\n\r\nIn the future, M2M and IoT markets are projected to require deployment of tens of billions of connected devices. A significant number of those devices is expected to use wireless technologies like those supported by Qualcomm.\r\n\r\n“If Qualcomm succeeds in developing features in products that makes those products the best choice when developing M2M and IoT devices, it may turn out to be a huge market for Qualcomm,” he said. “The technology being discussed and standardized in this project has the potential to impact very large markets in the future and impact our lives in a very positive way through smart grids, smart houses, connective CE, lights, appliances, smart cities, and smart vehicles.”\r\n<h3>The family vintage</h3>\r\nBorn and raised in the Pfalz region of southwest Germany, Josef now lives about 40 miles west of his birthplace in the village of Forst. It’s an area famed for wine-growing, and the wine culture – grape-growing, wine-making, and wine consumption -- is a central theme in the community’s day-to-day life. It’s even part of the Blanz family: his wife Anja grew up on a winery in Forst and her sister and brother-in-law still run the family business today.\r\n\r\nIt’s no surprise that wine-related topics run a close second to technology when Josef talks about his personal interests. “That is a must in our village,” he said. “I am not really an expert or connoisseur, but I like wine-tasting and enjoy learning more and more about wine.”\r\n\r\nHis ideal day? “Enjoying the Forster Weinfest on a nice, warm summer day with family and friends while strolling between booths and wineries enjoying good food, listening to good live music, talking with people I know well and not so well and, of course, drinking some good wine.”\r\n\r\nThe father of three children ranging in ages from 13 to 9, Josef makes sure all sorts of things are connected in his home. He set up a large touchscreen in the kitchen to control everything. He checks on his house and change settings while traveling and opens the door and gate from his phone or laptop.\r\n<h3>Hooked on BASIC as a teen-ager</h3>\r\nJosef originally set out follow in the footsteps of his father, a civil engineer. He changed career directions when, as a teen-ager, he tried his hand at BASIC programming on his father’s work computer. He was hooked, and wound up earning a degree in electrical engineering. He studied engineering at the University of Kaiserslautern, which at the time was home to one of the location of one of the world’s leading research teams on CDMA. While still an undergraduate, Josef designed a Viterbi Equalizer for the group, which led to the offer of a post-graduate position with an option to get a Ph. D., which he accepted.\r\n\r\nOne of his mentors at the university was Dr. Paul Walter Baier, one of the few CDMA experts in Germany at that time and an acquaintance of Qualcomm co-founder Andrew Viterbi.\r\n\r\n“He was a tough guy,” Josef said of Baier. “He taught me that you need to keep on working on a problem until you really get to the bottom of it and don’t give up halfway.”\r\n\r\nJosef joined Qualcomm in 1998, just as the company was trying to crack the 3GPP market and ramping up efforts to implement MTS chips. He recalls it was an uphill battle for Qualcomm to be accepted as a solid contributor interested in producing effective technology. But by a decade later, Qualcomm had become a leader in 3GPP technology.\r\n<h3>Diverse approach fits Standards group</h3>\r\nOver the years, he said the emphasis of the standards group has shifted.\r\n\r\n“Initially the focus was on 3GPP and 3GPP2, but today the set of groups we attend and work with is much more diverse,” he said.\r\n\r\nJosef is excited to be involved with wireless technology that has made it easier to stay in touch with family and friends from almost any place.\r\n\r\n“Without wireless technology I would have a very hard time traveling as much as I do,” he said. “It helps in so many situations to talk to family, to be reachable for business, to stay connected, do email, conference calls, get information off the web, all while on the go.”\r\n\r\nHis Standards project recently reached a significant milestone − Completion of a first release of specifications for M2M communications based on an M2M Service layer produced within oneM2M, a global partnership of SDOs created to support the M2M/IoT concept.\r\n\r\n“This standard has the potential to become a key enabler for larger scale M2M/IoT deployments across a number of different industry segments,” Josef said. “It may allow Qualcomm to develop products that could be sold into various industry segments or so-called verticals without the need for vertical-specific product specializations.”\r\n<h3>Building success through oneM2M</h3>\r\nJosef was a key player in the creation of oneM2M, and helped get a Qualcomm consultant Peter Nurse selected as chair of the oneM2M Technical Plenary, a move that he believes will help speed up progress in oneM2M and ensure that Qualcomm maintains a leadership role in the organization.\r\n\r\nBut as M2M/IoT gets bigger, there are more challenges. “Almost every other week you can see press releases about yet another organization that wants to cover the whole breadth and depth of M2m/IOT.\r\n\r\nThat fragmentation makes for competing groups, primarily pushed by Qualcomm competitors. The key to solving this is consolidation and a reasonable work split.\r\n\r\n“We have to stay on top of which organizations are really relevant and keep on consolidating and aligning across those in order to avoid overlap and enable interworking,” he said.\r\n\r\nPart of his challenge is overcoming skepticism from other companies when Qualcomm gets involved with a new standards organization.\r\n\r\n“Many other stakeholders suspect that we are only interested in pushing our own IPR,” he said. That sort of test arose recently in the oneM2M group when some features Qualcomm wanted specified as mandatory were watered down.\r\n\r\n“The best way to deal with such a situation is to focus on making our preferred solutions technically better and specify them in a precise manner so that using them in an implementation provides added value,” Josef said.\r\n\r\nIt takes time, he said, but after a while, individual delegates realize that Qualcomm representatives are actually quite reasonable and begin to trust that the company is interested only in designing a technically sound and proper system.\r\n\r\nHis immediate focus is on incorporating the technology specified in oneM2M with the technology Qualcomm promotes in the open source-based AllSeen Alliance and on promoting the overall value of oneM2M technology. Those efforts, Josef said, will help Qualcomm position its products for the M2M/IoT markets to make them the best choice for implementers.\r\n<h3>Setting standards for the future</h3>\r\nBlanz said it’s rewarding to work with a diverse group of people both within Qualcomm and externally.\r\n\r\n“Through the work in international and global standardization bodies, you get to know very different styles of communicating and ways of working with each other,” he said. “You get the rare opportunity to constantly improve your understanding of different cultures and mentalities. This is a very valuable skill that cannot be learned in many other jobs.”\r\n\r\nHe also appreciates the opportunity to be part of an effort that is shaping the future of M2M/IoT technology and affecting the lives of today’s generations and generations to come.\r\n\r\n“It is motivating to see – sometimes over the span of quite a few years – that a few things you have been dealing with in standards actually make it into products and ultimately affect the way we live.”[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3" animation="none" column_padding="padding-8-percent" column_padding_position="top" background_color_opacity="1"][image_with_animation image_url="157" animation="Fade In" img_link_target="_self"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" id="profile2"][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Rolf De Vegt</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\r\n<h4>Political approach to Standards proves successful for Rolf De Vegt</h4>\r\nAs a young man, Rolf De Vegt dreamed of growing up to become a politician in his native Netherlands. He wound up going into private business instead, but in his current role as Senior Director of Technical Standards for Qualcomm Atheros, the challenges he faces in Standards negotiations give him plenty of opportunity to put his political skills to the test.\r\n\r\n“Getting bogged down because of company political reasons can sometimes be challenging to work around,” he said. “But you just work through it, push through, making sure you make progress, finding your alliances, finding companies and individuals that have similar positions and interests, finding ways to appease or to remove barriers. That’s what the political side of Standardization is all about.”\r\n\r\nSan Jose-based De Vegt is the Standards lead for the IEEE 802.11 technologies. He also heads a Standards group for Qualcomm Atheros focused on technologies such as Bluetooth, NFC, wireless, and WLAN. Active in the Wi-Fi industry since 2001, De Vegt has chaired several key groups in the Wi-Fi Alliance. He currently serves on the Wi-Fi Alliance board of directors and chairs a committee tasked with defining Standards for devices that implement the IEEE 802.11ah standards.\r\n<h3>Steering clear of engineering</h3>\r\nRolf was born in the Netherlands, in the small town of Best south of Amsterdam, but grew up in the northern part of the country. He graduated from Nienoord College in Leek, Netherlands, and earned a master’s degree from Twente University. His degree was in public administration despite strong family ties to the engineering profession: Rolf’s father was a civil engineer and his two brothers also grew up to be engineers, one an environmental engineer for SAP and the second as a food technologist for a Dutch company.\r\n\r\nHe initially wanted to make his mark in Dutch politics but the reality of how political systems work eventually steered him in a different direction. “I probably don’t have enough patience with the slowness of the process,” he said. “But it also was having to deal with the other people in that profession.” Rolf said he’s much more comfortable working with engineers, “who aren’t so concerned with politics and perception.”\r\n\r\nHe launched his career as a management consultant, working for the Dutch Department of Finance and later for Adventis Management Consulting. But in 2001, some friends who were engineers sought to start a Wi-Fi semiconductor company and asked him to help develop a business plan. They connected with a group in the U.S. involved in a similar venture and wound up launching a startup focused on creating Wi-Fi chipsets and MIMO for the chipsets. The only non-engineer on board, he started out as a product manager, but his role evolved into handing Standards issues through his work with industry organizations such as the Wi-Fi Alliance and IEEE. He joined Qualcomm when the company, Airgo Networks, was acquired in 2006.\r\n<h3>Developing cutting-edge technology products</h3>\r\nToday, Rolf and his husband, a partner with a large accounting firm, live in San Francisco. He enjoys playing water polo, and dabbling in real estate projects in his non-working hours. He’s a frequent visitor to the nearby Sonoma wine country and enjoys traveling, especially to southeast Asia, where he spends a lot of time.\r\n\r\nIn his work with QCA, he enjoys the cutting-edge approach and constant movement of technology projects. “You’re working on something that you’ll see in the marketplace three, four, or five years from now, sometimes even seven or eight years,” he said. “You need to be forward-thinking and plot out how you can achieve what you want to achieve for your company and your team.”\r\n\r\nHis current role gives him a chance to work with content development, providing road maps and guidance for the direction in which the technologies will evolve. He focuses on identifying what kind of market opportunities the company should go after and how technologies can fit in a market or consumer needs context. “That’s where I can add a lot of value,” Rolf said.\r\n\r\nStill, there are challenges ahead when it comes to setting Wi-Fi standards, principally the growing strength of Asian companies, especially in China. “That’s a trend we have to deal with,” he said. “Qualcomm is doing well on the competitive side. That means our competition is getting nervous and lashing out more.”\r\n<h3>Driving the Standards evolution</h3>\r\nRolf said the best part of his work in Standards is the chance “to work with really smart people and to create opportunities for Qualcomm to compete. A lot of our work is driven by Standards and Standards evolution, and a lot of opportunities are created by that,” he said.\r\n\r\nRolf’s team has been successful in pushing through standards for IEEE 802.11ah technology, a key for enabling the Internet of Things (IoT). “It’s a new standard that allows for very low power consumption and very long range that targets battery-operated devices in homes and other locations. That’s been primarily driven by Qualcomm and Qualcomm engineers, and I think that’s a huge achievement.” He’s also working to make sure the Wi-Fi interoperability program for the 802.11ah Standards launches. The Wi-Fi Alliance group Rolf chairs is defining the program, and he’s driving the activity for the organization.\r\n\r\n“I want to make sure that 12 months from now, we’ve made a lot of progress on that and that we are on our way to building a forceful ecosystem around that particular Standard.” He predicts the emergence of this new technology will create additional opportunities for Qualcomm down the road.\r\n<h3>New opportunity in multiuser MIMO</h3>\r\nThanks in part to Rolf’s influence, the Wi-Fi Alliance also is moving ahead with an IEEE 802.11ac Standards program, which will launch a new technology called multiuser MIMO. “The whole transition to multiuser MIMO is creating all kinds of advantages for our products here at Qualcomm Atheros,” he said. “We are probably the first in the market, so the opportunity has been created by the standard and the Wi-Fi Alliance program.”\r\n\r\nBy executing on time with its products, QCA has gained a large share in the enterprise and consumer Wi-Fi markets. “It positions us better in the whole emerging IoT and wearables market with a fresh new technology,” Rolf said\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, Rolf predicts a major transition in the Wi-Fi industry over the emerging IEEE 802.11ax technology. “We want to make sure that we have a key role in defining what’s going to be in that Standard,” he said. “That’s important both from a timeline management standpoint, but also from an IP content perspective.” Those Standards, Rolf said, will provide an opportunity for Qualcomm to expand its leadership in Wi-Fi in the handheld device market.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][image_with_animation image_url="158" animation="Fade In" img_link_target="_self"][/vc_column][/vc_row]', 'Employee Profiles', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'employee-profiles', '', '', '2015-05-07 18:03:53', '2015-05-07 18:03:53', '', 0, 'http://qsiodev.runq.qualcomm.com/?page_id=105', 0, 'page', '', 0),

A principal engineer with QSIO Germany, Blanz leads Qualcomm’s Machine-to-Machine Communication/Internet of Things (M2M/IoT) Standards project.\n\nHis work focuses on the best way to get all sorts of machines and things connected to one another and to the Cloud. At the same time, he looks to keep communications resource-efficient and to allow simple use of network connectivity by application and product developers.\n\nIn the future, M2M and IoT markets are projected to require deployment of tens of billions of connected devices. A significant number of those devices is expected to use wireless technologies like those supported by Qualcomm.\n\n“If Qualcomm succeeds in developing features in products that makes those products the best choice when developing M2M and IoT devices, it may turn out to be a huge market for Qualcomm,” he said. “The technology being discussed and standardized in this project has the potential to impact very large markets in the future and impact our lives in a very positive way through smart grids, smart houses, connective CE, lights, appliances, smart cities, and smart vehicles.”\n<h3>The family vintage</h3>\nBorn and raised in the Pfalz region of southwest Germany, Josef now lives about 40 miles west of his birthplace in the village of Forst. It’s an area famed for wine-growing, and the wine culture – grape-growing, wine-making, and wine consumption -- is a central theme in the community’s day-to-day life. It’s even part of the Blanz family: his wife Anja grew up on a winery in Forst and her sister and brother-in-law still run the family business today.\n\nIt’s no surprise that wine-related topics run a close second to technology when Josef talks about his personal interests. “That is a must in our village,” he said. “I am not really an expert or connoisseur, but I like wine-tasting and enjoy learning more and more about wine.”\n\nHis ideal day? “Enjoying the Forster Weinfest on a nice, warm summer day with family and friends while strolling between booths and wineries enjoying good food, listening to good live music, talking with people I know well and not so well and, of course, drinking some good wine.”\n\nThe father of three children ranging in ages from 13 to 9, Josef makes sure all sorts of things are connected in his home. He set up a large touchscreen in the kitchen to control everything. He checks on his house and change settings while traveling and opens the door and gate from his phone or laptop.\n<h3>Hooked on BASIC as a teen-ager</h3>\nJosef originally set out follow in the footsteps of his father, a civil engineer. He changed career directions when, as a teen-ager, he tried his hand at BASIC programming on his father’s work computer. He was hooked, and wound up earning a degree in electrical engineering. He studied engineering at the University of Kaiserslautern, which at the time was home to one of the location of one of the world’s leading research teams on CDMA. While still an undergraduate, Josef designed a Viterbi Equalizer for the group, which led to the offer of a post-graduate position with an option to get a Ph. D., which he accepted.\n\nOne of his mentors at the university was Dr. Paul Walter Baier, one of the few CDMA experts in Germany at that time and an acquaintance of Qualcomm co-founder Andrew Viterbi.\n\n“He was a tough guy,” Josef said of Baier. “He taught me that you need to keep on working on a problem until you really get to the bottom of it and don’t give up halfway.”\n\nJosef joined Qualcomm in 1998, just as the company was trying to crack the 3GPP market and ramping up efforts to implement MTS chips. He recalls it was an uphill battle for Qualcomm to be accepted as a solid contributor interested in producing effective technology. But by a decade later, Qualcomm had become a leader in 3GPP technology.\n<h3>Diverse approach fits Standards group</h3>\nOver the years, he said the emphasis of the standards group has shifted.\n\n“Initially the focus was on 3GPP and 3GPP2, but today the set of groups we attend and work with is much more diverse,” he said.\n\nJosef is excited to be involved with wireless technology that has made it easier to stay in touch with family and friends from almost any place.\n\n“Without wireless technology I would have a very hard time traveling as much as I do,” he said. “It helps in so many situations to talk to family, to be reachable for business, to stay connected, do email, conference calls, get information off the web, all while on the go.”\n\nHis Standards project recently reached a significant milestone − Completion of a first release of specifications for M2M communications based on an M2M Service layer produced within oneM2M, a global partnership of SDOs created to support the M2M/IoT concept.\n\n“This standard has the potential to become a key enabler for larger scale M2M/IoT deployments across a number of different industry segments,” Josef said. “It may allow Qualcomm to develop products that could be sold into various industry segments or so-called verticals without the need for vertical-specific product specializations.”\n<h3>Building success through oneM2M</h3>\nJosef was a key player in the creation of oneM2M, and helped get a Qualcomm consultant Peter Nurse selected as chair of the oneM2M Technical Plenary, a move that he believes will help speed up progress in oneM2M and ensure that Qualcomm maintains a leadership role in the organization.\n\nBut as M2M/IoT gets bigger, there are more challenges. “Almost every other week you can see press releases about yet another organization that wants to cover the whole breadth and depth of M2m/IOT.\n\nThat fragmentation makes for competing groups, primarily pushed by Qualcomm competitors.

Our initial solution transferred vehicle accident related data (vehicle location, identity, crash related sensor data) using an inband modem (sharing the voice path) over an automated emergency call from a vehicle to a PSAP. The QSIO inband solution was chosen by 3GPP and is mandated for deployment in new vehicles in the EU by 2018. In 2014, QSIO lead a task force in ETSI to define a Next Generation (NG) version of eCall based on LTE access [wpex more="..." less=""] and IMS in which vehicle data transfer would occur via IMS signaling and not over the voice path. We are also driving this in the IETF. We are adding the ETSI NG solution into 3GPP specs to enable EU operators to migrate from the inband solution as they deploy LTE and IMS.

The initial solution in 3GPP 5 years ago supported voice calls (VoLTE) and is deployed in our products and in networks all over the world by numerous operators. Support of additional media (text, video, IM) was added by 3GPP around 3 years ago and should be deployed by US operators and supported in our products over the next few years. 3GPP is now studying VoWLAN access at the behest of many US and EU operators, and QSIO is a leading contributor. In addition, QSIO is active in IETF, with regional SDOs in the EU (EENA, ETSI) and China (CCSA, TIAA) [wpex more="..." less=""] and with vehicle telematics providers (Onstar, Verizon Telematics) to enable Next Generation IMS-based E911 solutions to evolve and support a panoply of emergency related services including eCall, mHealth, personal emergency calls, human language negotiation, all using a common IMS solution in carriers.

Standards work in ILA has slowed due to uncertainties within the industry as to how accurate indoor location should best evolve. However, if standards solutions regain prominence (e.g., as a consequence of the FCC mandate on indoor E911 location), we and ILA will be in a position to quickly roll out a standard solution.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="center center" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="light" text_align="left" top_padding="8%" id="spectrumengineering" parallax_bg="true" bottom_padding="3%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]\n<h2>Spectrum Engineering</h2>\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="3%" bottom_padding="5%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]In the quest to solve the 1000x mobile data challenge, spectrum is an important building block. Given that spectrum is a finite resource, the industry is hard at work to utilize the available spectrum in the most efficient manner and to identify opportunities to open more spectrum for mobile data. To achieve these goals in support of Qualcomm’s business strategies, the Spectrum Engineering team performs technical analysis and attends relevant regional/international regulatory groups and SDOs to present the result of our studies and to defend Qualcomm’s positions. We target both licensed spectrum for exclusive use by mobile systems such as LTE and future 5th Generation and unlicensed spectrum for shared used by wireless systems such as WiFi and LTE-U. In addition, we work to unlock government spectrum, which is partially occupied, based on Licensed Shared Access for shared licensed use by mobile systems. Our team closely works with relevant QSIO/QCT/GA teams for a tight inter-company coordination.\n<h3>New spectrum resources for mobile broadband IMT/LTE</h3>\nWe are active in global efforts to identify and open new spectrum for mobile broadband. An essential requirement in these efforts is to assist global harmonization of candidate bands in the interest of Qualcomm’s business.\n<h3>China</h3>\n[wpex more="..." less=""]We worked in several regions jointly with other companies on opening the band 3400-3600 MHz for IMT/LTE. Our current aim is to open this band in China by participating in the CCSA coexistence studies between IMT and the incumbent Fixed Satellite Systems (FSS). Since 2008, we have actively participated in the CCSA studies on band plan for 450-4570 MHz. We assist the Chinese government in coexistence studies between IMT and incumbent services (railway trunking system, broadcast system, radio location) in co-channel and adjacent bands deployment scenarios and promote the globally harmonized IMT FDD allocation as the band plan for China. We also work on 3300-3400 MHz, 4400-4500 MHz and 4800-4890 MHz bands, which are new spectrum supported by China for IMT.[/wpex]\n<h3>Japan</h3>\n[wpex more="..." less=""]Japan’s focus is to open the IMT band for Mobile Satellite Systems (MSS), Downlink: 2170 - 2200 MHz/Uplink: 1980 - 2010 MHz, for terrestrial use. Qualcomm proposed a terrestrial/satellite hybrid system in response to the MIC’s call for proposals in 2013. Softbank Mobile adopted xHRPD (the satellite component in Qualcomm’s hybrid system proposal) as their proposed system and started to work with MIC to acquire this spectrum. We aim to work with Softbank to open the band for terrestrial use.[/wpex]\n<h3>Europe</h3>\n[wpex more="..." less=""]In Europe, we led the technical work in CEPT/ITU-R Joint Task Group (JTG) on Agenda Item 1.2 of WRC 2015 for clearing the UHF 700 MHz TV band for IMT/LTE operation. This defines limits for out-of-band (OOB) emissions caused by LTE UE transmitters in this band to the Digital TV devices receiving below the band. The limits meet QCT requirements and allow a single device implementation based on 3GPP LTE Band 28 for operation in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.[/wpex]\n<h3>Promotion of Licensed Shared Access (LSA) concept</h3>\nWe are actively involved in Qualcomm’s effort to promote LSA concept as a means for opening additional globally harmonized licensed spectrum for mobile data. Based on our initiative, the Japanese MIC included LSA in its Spectrum Strategy Report as one of technologies for spectrum sharing in the middle term. In China, we contributed to the CCSA LSA work and are currently involved in the CCSA efforts to publish a white paper on LSA. In cooperation with Qualcomm’s standardization and GA teams in Europe, we were successful in opening the 2.3 GHz in several CEPT countries for LTE operation on an LSA basis.\n<h3>Spectrum for 5G</h3>\nWe started work on spectrum for the 5<sup>th</sup> Generation (5G) of mobile communications systems by participating in the regulatory groups of different regions and also in the spectrum project of NGMN with a goal of more and better global harmonized spectrum.\n\nIn China, CCSA has launched 5G studies addressing requirements, candidate technologies, and spectrum needs. CCSA will act as external interface for the China IMT-2020 Promotion Group (PG) to international (e.g., ITU-R/3GPP) and regional (e.g., CJK/EU) SDOs.\n<h3>New spectrum in 5 GHz band for Wireless Access Systems (WAS) including WLANs</h3>\nWe are active in global efforts on 5 GHz band expansion for WAS including WLANs to promote Qualcomm''s strategy respecting Wi-Fi, LTE-LAA, and DSRC businesses. In Japan, our suggestions were accepted at a Technical Study Group of MIC that is investigating new spectrum for WLAN in 5 GHz. We are involved in similar efforts in the US, Europe, and China. In collaboration with NTIA, Cisco, Intel, and Broadcom, our Spectrum Engineering team developed a software tool to analyze WLANs coexistence with radars for providing contributions to ITU-R, the US-JTG, and CEPT groups CPG PTD and SE24.\n<h3>Regulations for 60 GHz (IEEE 802.11ad)</h3>\nWe are working on new regulations for 60 GHz in Japan. As of April 2015, the conducted output power is limited to 10 mW, much lower than the limit allowed in other countries. This puts considerable restrictions on the IEEE 802.11ad operation in Japan. MIC created a committee to discuss new 60 GHz regulations for Japan. Qualcomm gained support for much higher power for devices in 60 GHz. It was agreed to increase the conducted output power to 250 mW (10 dBi or more antenna gain is required when more than 10 mW is used). The discussions on the Rx spurious emission limits are ongoing.\n<h3>Sub-GHz unlicensed spectrum for 80.11ah</h3>\nWe are leading studies in Europe and China on technical conditions for the operation of 801.11ah in the sub-GHz band. In Europe, we created at CEPT ECC a Work Item for studies on coexistence between 802.11ah based Wideband Short Range Devices (SRDs) and other SRDs in the band 870-876 MHz/915-921 MHz. We are driving these studies and targeting the finalization of work in mid-2015.\n\nSince 2013, we have studied with China 801.11ah spectrum needs and proposed 900 MHz as the target spectrum according to analysis of Chinese spectrum allocation and global 11ah spectrum status. We are performing spectrum predictions to justify the need for 5 MHz spectrum for 802.11ah in 920-925 MHz and are performing coexistence studies to address interference concerns of incumbents.\n<h3>Spectrum for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)/V2X (Vehicle to Vehicle/Infrastructure)</h3>\nSince 2015, we have started seeking some dedicated spectrum for V2X safety application in China. We have joined the work on spectrum demand prediction, as well as the coexistence studies between 802.11p / LTE based V2X technology and incumbent services in the targeted bands and adjacent bands.\n<h3>3GPP back-office technical work</h3>\nWe support Qualcomm’s 3GPP RAN4 team by performing interference analysis and coexistence studies between 3GPP systems deployments in adjacent bands and between such systems and other services in adjacent bands.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="center center" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="light" text_align="left" top_padding="8%" id="regionalupdate" parallax_bg="true" bottom_padding="3%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]\n<h2>Regional Update</h2>\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="5%" bottom_padding="5%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\n<h3>China</h3>\n<h4>LTE</h4>\nThe LTE TDD network rapidly deployed after the Chinese government formally issued LTE TDD licenses to all three operators in December 2013. By the end of 2014, CMCC had deployed nationwide 700K LTE TDD eNB, and domestic 4G subscribers reached 80 million. CT and CU were granted FDD licenses in February 2015, one year after an FDD/TDD hybrid network trial, and rolled out LTE service in more than 50 cities. Qualcomm is driving a multi-SIM, multimode solution and standardization to support the explosively growing LTE smartphone market despite fierce competition.\n<h4>5G</h4>\nChina’s 2015 focus switched from academic research to industry promotion. Led by the National High-Tech Project[wpex more="..." less=""] (863-5G project), China aims to play a more influential role in 5G, with academia and industry researching 5G candidate technologies and system architecture. Qualcomm is establishing a 5G leadership position by participating in all related 5G activities in the FuTURE Forum and CCSA, and giving keynote speeches in the most influential 5G summits.\n<h4>Spectrum</h4>\nChinese regulators are responding to the industry’s demand for spectrum. Qualcomm is taking advantage of the opportunity to influence China spectrum planning and seeking more global harmonized spectrum for IMT and other new services that Qualcomm is promoting, such as WPT, V2X and 802.11ah.\n<h4>Automotive</h4>\nTelematics and ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) have received widespread attention in China. Several industry alliances were established by the government and industries to pursue urgently needed standardization and solutions from various perspectives such as V2V, V2I, emergency and maintenance service, etc. Qualcomm is coordinating the efforts in CCSA, TIAA, and C-ITS to achieve a unified solution acceptable for all interested ministries and virtual industries.\n<h4>Internet of Things (IoT)</h4>\nIn the IoT realm, Smart homes, e-Health/m-Health, and Industry 4.0 attract interest. Qualcomm is actively involved in eUICC and smart wearables standardization, 11ah and oneM2M Rel.1 transpositions in CCSA, and promoting AllJoyn.\n<h4>Wireless charging</h4>\nChina Regulator, Government Research and Test Forces, and pioneer handset vendors show increasing interest in wireless charging technologies. However many of them are more familiar with the first-generation technology from WPC. QSIO made multiple introductions and promotions of A4WP and its technical work to CCSA and CATR. Qualcomm is also driving WPT spectrum study in China to ensure the best legality of using 6.78 MHz for A4WP/WiPower™.\n<h4>Standards reform</h4>\nThe Chinese central government is driving standards reform, with an aim to diminish recommended industry standards and encourage consortia to develop standards based on market needs and technical progress. Standards development gradually move to industry alliance and associations, which will give Qualcomm more flexibility and opportunities to bring advanced technologies and products into the China market.\n\n[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\n<h3>Korea</h3>\n<h4>5G</h4>\nKorean OEMs and operators are interested in 5G deployment. The 5G Forum and Korean industry are focused on the mmWave channel model, 5G evaluation methodology, and 5G system architecture. The government will have a trial service in PyeongChang in 2018. Leveraging a strong technology position will help Qualcomm negotiate 5G licensing with OEMs.\n<h4>Wireless Power Transmission (WPT)</h4>\nQSIO is leading WPT in Korea. CJK, WPT, and ITU-R WP1A organized a new group to evaluate the value of WPT technologies. To harmonize operating frequency, it will be helpful for OEMs to get Qualcomm solutions, such as A4WP and Halo™. Samsung announced S6 will adopt the (non-Qualcomm) Qi (WPC) solution, but LGE is interested in A4WP.\n\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\n<h3>Japan</h3>\n<h4>2020 Tokyo Olympic Games</h4>\nThe current buzz in Japan is about the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is promoting various types of new advanced wireless technologies and revising the spectrum policies with an eye towards 2020. Future plans for 5G promotion/trial and other upcoming technologies are being undertaken.\n<h4>Fifth Generation Mobile Communications Promotion Forum</h4>\nThe Fifth Generation Mobile Communications Promotion Forum (5GMF) was established in September 2014 by telecom companies, academic experts, ARIB, TTC, and MIC. 5GMF promotes research and development of 5G and[wpex more="..." less=""] foresees international collaborations. Qualcomm covers all 5GMF committees. MIC is working on technology rules and spectrum policies on advanced LTE technologies, 5 GHz technologies, and 60 GHz technologies.

A principal engineer with QSIO Germany, Blanz leads Qualcomm’s Machine-to-Machine Communication/Internet of Things (M2M/IoT) Standards project.\r\n\r\nHis work focuses on the best way to get all sorts of machines and things connected to one another and to the Cloud. At the same time, he looks to keep communications resource-efficient and to allow simple use of network connectivity by application and product developers.\r\n\r\nIn the future, M2M and IoT markets are projected to require deployment of tens of billions of connected devices. A significant number of those devices is expected to use wireless technologies like those supported by Qualcomm.\r\n\r\n“If Qualcomm succeeds in developing features in products that makes those products the best choice when developing M2M and IoT devices, it may turn out to be a huge market for Qualcomm,” he said. “The technology being discussed and standardized in this project has the potential to impact very large markets in the future and impact our lives in a very positive way through smart grids, smart houses, connective CE, lights, appliances, smart cities, and smart vehicles.”\r\n<h3>The family vintage</h3>\r\nBorn and raised in the Pfalz region of southwest Germany, Josef now lives about 40 miles west of his birthplace in the village of Forst. It’s an area famed for wine-growing, and the wine culture – grape-growing, wine-making, and wine consumption -- is a central theme in the community’s day-to-day life. It’s even part of the Blanz family: his wife Anja grew up on a winery in Forst and her sister and brother-in-law still run the family business today.\r\n\r\nIt’s no surprise that wine-related topics run a close second to technology when Josef talks about his personal interests. “That is a must in our village,” he said. “I am not really an expert or connoisseur, but I like wine-tasting and enjoy learning more and more about wine.”\r\n\r\nHis ideal day? “Enjoying the Forster Weinfest on a nice, warm summer day with family and friends while strolling between booths and wineries enjoying good food, listening to good live music, talking with people I know well and not so well and, of course, drinking some good wine.”\r\n\r\nThe father of three children ranging in ages from 13 to 9, Josef makes sure all sorts of things are connected in his home. He set up a large touchscreen in the kitchen to control everything. He checks on his house and change settings while traveling and opens the door and gate from his phone or laptop.\r\n<h3>Hooked on BASIC as a teen-ager</h3>\r\nJosef originally set out follow in the footsteps of his father, a civil engineer. He changed career directions when, as a teen-ager, he tried his hand at BASIC programming on his father’s work computer. He was hooked, and wound up earning a degree in electrical engineering. He studied engineering at the University of Kaiserslautern, which at the time was home to one of the location of one of the world’s leading research teams on CDMA. While still an undergraduate, Josef designed a Viterbi Equalizer for the group, which led to the offer of a post-graduate position with an option to get a Ph. D., which he accepted.\r\n\r\nOne of his mentors at the university was Dr. Paul Walter Baier, one of the few CDMA experts in Germany at that time and an acquaintance of Qualcomm co-founder Andrew Viterbi.\r\n\r\n“He was a tough guy,” Josef said of Baier. “He taught me that you need to keep on working on a problem until you really get to the bottom of it and don’t give up halfway.”\r\n\r\nJosef joined Qualcomm in 1998, just as the company was trying to crack the 3GPP market and ramping up efforts to implement MTS chips. He recalls it was an uphill battle for Qualcomm to be accepted as a solid contributor interested in producing effective technology. But by a decade later, Qualcomm had become a leader in 3GPP technology.\r\n<h3>Diverse approach fits Standards group</h3>\r\nOver the years, he said the emphasis of the standards group has shifted.\r\n\r\n“Initially the focus was on 3GPP and 3GPP2, but today the set of groups we attend and work with is much more diverse,” he said.\r\n\r\nJosef is excited to be involved with wireless technology that has made it easier to stay in touch with family and friends from almost any place.\r\n\r\n“Without wireless technology I would have a very hard time traveling as much as I do,” he said. “It helps in so many situations to talk to family, to be reachable for business, to stay connected, do email, conference calls, get information off the web, all while on the go.”\r\n\r\nHis Standards project recently reached a significant milestone − Completion of a first release of specifications for M2M communications based on an M2M Service layer produced within oneM2M, a global partnership of SDOs created to support the M2M/IoT concept.\r\n\r\n“This standard has the potential to become a key enabler for larger scale M2M/IoT deployments across a number of different industry segments,” Josef said. “It may allow Qualcomm to develop products that could be sold into various industry segments or so-called verticals without the need for vertical-specific product specializations.”\r\n<h3>Building success through oneM2M</h3>\r\nJosef was a key player in the creation of oneM2M, and helped get a Qualcomm consultant Peter Nurse selected as chair of the oneM2M Technical Plenary, a move that he believes will help speed up progress in oneM2M and ensure that Qualcomm maintains a leadership role in the organization.\r\n\r\nBut as M2M/IoT gets bigger, there are more challenges. “Almost every other week you can see press releases about yet another organization that wants to cover the whole breadth and depth of M2m/IOT.\r\n\r\nThat fragmentation makes for competing groups, primarily pushed by Qualcomm competitors. The key to solving this is consolidation and a reasonable work split.\r\n\r\n“We have to stay on top of which organizations are really relevant and keep on consolidating and aligning across those in order to avoid overlap and enable interworking,” he said.\r\n\r\nPart of his challenge is overcoming skepticism from other companies when Qualcomm gets involved with a new standards organization.\r\n\r\n“Many other stakeholders suspect that we are only interested in pushing our own IPR,” he said. That sort of test arose recently in the oneM2M group when some features Qualcomm wanted specified as mandatory were watered down.\r\n\r\n“The best way to deal with such a situation is to focus on making our preferred solutions technically better and specify them in a precise manner so that using them in an implementation provides added value,” Josef said.\r\n\r\nIt takes time, he said, but after a while, individual delegates realize that Qualcomm representatives are actually quite reasonable and begin to trust that the company is interested only in designing a technically sound and proper system.\r\n\r\nHis immediate focus is on incorporating the technology specified in oneM2M with the technology Qualcomm promotes in the open source-based AllSeen Alliance and on promoting the overall value of oneM2M technology. Those efforts, Josef said, will help Qualcomm position its products for the M2M/IoT markets to make them the best choice for implementers.\r\n<h3>Setting standards for the future</h3>\r\nBlanz said it’s rewarding to work with a diverse group of people both within Qualcomm and externally.\r\n\r\n“Through the work in international and global standardization bodies, you get to know very different styles of communicating and ways of working with each other,” he said. “You get the rare opportunity to constantly improve your understanding of different cultures and mentalities. This is a very valuable skill that cannot be learned in many other jobs.”\r\n\r\nHe also appreciates the opportunity to be part of an effort that is shaping the future of M2M/IoT technology and affecting the lives of today’s generations and generations to come.\r\n\r\n“It is motivating to see – sometimes over the span of quite a few years – that a few things you have been dealing with in standards actually make it into products and ultimately affect the way we live.”[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3" animation="none" column_padding="padding-8-percent" column_padding_position="top" background_color_opacity="1"][image_with_animation image_url="157" animation="Fade In" img_link_target="_self"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" id="profile2"][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Rolf De Vegt</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\r\n<h4>Political approach to Standards proves successful for Rolf De Vegt</h4>\r\nAs a young man, Rolf De Vegt dreamed of growing up to become a politician in his native Netherlands. He wound up going into private business instead, but in his current role as Senior Director of Technical Standards for Qualcomm Atheros, the challenges he faces in Standards negotiations give him plenty of opportunity to put his political skills to the test.\r\n\r\n“Getting bogged down because of company political reasons can sometimes be challenging to work around,” he said. “But you just work through it, push through, making sure you make progress, finding your alliances, finding companies and individuals that have similar positions and interests, finding ways to appease or to remove barriers. That’s what the political side of Standardization is all about.”\r\n\r\nSan Jose-based De Vegt is the Standards lead for the IEEE 802.11 technologies. He also heads a Standards group for Qualcomm Atheros focused on technologies such as Bluetooth, NFC, wireless, and WLAN. Active in the Wi-Fi industry since 2001, De Vegt has chaired several key groups in the Wi-Fi Alliance. He currently serves on the Wi-Fi Alliance board of directors and chairs a committee tasked with defining Standards for devices that implement the IEEE 802.11ah standards.\r\n<h3>Steering clear of engineering</h3>\r\nRolf was born in the Netherlands, in the small town of Best south of Amsterdam, but grew up in the northern part of the country. He graduated from Nienoord College in Leek, Netherlands, and earned a master’s degree from Twente University. His degree was in public administration despite strong family ties to the engineering profession: Rolf’s father was a civil engineer and his two brothers also grew up to be engineers, one an environmental engineer for SAP and the second as a food technologist for a Dutch company.\r\n\r\nHe initially wanted to make his mark in Dutch politics but the reality of how political systems work eventually steered him in a different direction. “I probably don’t have enough patience with the slowness of the process,” he said. “But it also was having to deal with the other people in that profession.” Rolf said he’s much more comfortable working with engineers, “who aren’t so concerned with politics and perception.”\r\n\r\nHe launched his career as a management consultant, working for the Dutch Department of Finance and later for Adventis Management Consulting. But in 2001, some friends who were engineers sought to start a Wi-Fi semiconductor company and asked him to help develop a business plan. They connected with a group in the U.S. involved in a similar venture and wound up launching a startup focused on creating Wi-Fi chipsets and MIMO for the chipsets. The only non-engineer on board, he started out as a product manager, but his role evolved into handing Standards issues through his work with industry organizations such as the Wi-Fi Alliance and IEEE. He joined Qualcomm when the company, Airgo Networks, was acquired in 2006.\r\n<h3>Developing cutting-edge technology products</h3>\r\nToday, Rolf and his husband, a partner with a large accounting firm, live in San Francisco. He enjoys playing water polo, and dabbling in real estate projects in his non-working hours. He’s a frequent visitor to the nearby Sonoma wine country and enjoys traveling, especially to southeast Asia, where he spends a lot of time.\r\n\r\nIn his work with QCA, he enjoys the cutting-edge approach and constant movement of technology projects. “You’re working on something that you’ll see in the marketplace three, four, or five years from now, sometimes even seven or eight years,” he said. “You need to be forward-thinking and plot out how you can achieve what you want to achieve for your company and your team.”\r\n\r\nHis current role gives him a chance to work with content development, providing road maps and guidance for the direction in which the technologies will evolve. He focuses on identifying what kind of market opportunities the company should go after and how technologies can fit in a market or consumer needs context. “That’s where I can add a lot of value,” Rolf said.\r\n\r\nStill, there are challenges ahead when it comes to setting Wi-Fi standards, principally the growing strength of Asian companies, especially in China. “That’s a trend we have to deal with,” he said. “Qualcomm is doing well on the competitive side. That means our competition is getting nervous and lashing out more.”\r\n<h3>Driving the Standards evolution</h3>\r\nRolf said the best part of his work in Standards is the chance “to work with really smart people and to create opportunities for Qualcomm to compete. A lot of our work is driven by Standards and Standards evolution, and a lot of opportunities are created by that,” he said.\r\n\r\nRolf’s team has been successful in pushing through standards for IEEE 802.11ah technology, a key for enabling the Internet of Things (IoT). “It’s a new standard that allows for very low power consumption and very long range that targets battery-operated devices in homes and other locations. That’s been primarily driven by Qualcomm and Qualcomm engineers, and I think that’s a huge achievement.” He’s also working to make sure the Wi-Fi interoperability program for the 802.11ah Standards launches. The Wi-Fi Alliance group Rolf chairs is defining the program, and he’s driving the activity for the organization.\r\n\r\n“I want to make sure that 12 months from now, we’ve made a lot of progress on that and that we are on our way to building a forceful ecosystem around that particular Standard.” He predicts the emergence of this new technology will create additional opportunities for Qualcomm down the road.\r\n<h3>New opportunity in multiuser MIMO</h3>\r\nThanks in part to Rolf’s influence, the Wi-Fi Alliance also is moving ahead with an IEEE 802.11ac Standards program, which will launch a new technology called multiuser MIMO. “The whole transition to multiuser MIMO is creating all kinds of advantages for our products here at Qualcomm Atheros,” he said. “We are probably the first in the market, so the opportunity has been created by the standard and the Wi-Fi Alliance program.”\r\n\r\nBy executing on time with its products, QCA has gained a large share in the enterprise and consumer Wi-Fi markets. “It positions us better in the whole emerging IoT and wearables market with a fresh new technology,” Rolf said\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, Rolf predicts a major transition in the Wi-Fi industry over the emerging IEEE 802.11ax technology. “We want to make sure that we have a key role in defining what’s going to be in that Standard,” he said. “That’s important both from a timeline management standpoint, but also from an IP content perspective.” Those Standards, Rolf said, will provide an opportunity for Qualcomm to expand its leadership in Wi-Fi in the handheld device market.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][image_with_animation image_url="158" animation="Fade In" img_link_target="_self"][/vc_column][/vc_row]', 'Employee Profiles', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '105-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-05-07 18:03:53', '2015-05-07 18:03:53', '', 105, 'http://qsiodev.runq.qualcomm.com/2015/05/07/105-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The purpose of oneM2M is to develop technical specifications that address the need for a M2M communication and data sharing platform for the cloud. This platform is called the M2M Service Layer and can be readily embedded within various hardware and software and relied upon to connect the large number of devices in the field with M2M application servers worldwide[wpex more="..." less="."]\n\nA critical objective of oneM2M is to attract and actively involve organizations from M2M-related business domains including telematics and intelligent transportation, healthcare, utilities, industrial automation, and smart homes. The M2M Service Layer is typically implemented as software that runs on a wide variety of things in the IoE like temperature sensors, door locks, TVs, air-conditioners, cars, smart homes, routers, and up to large computers in the cloud.\n\nThis software is like an operating system specially made for sensors/actors/machines/things that need to talk to each other. This software controls when it is OK to use communication networks to send or receive data, connects sensors/actors and the cloud in a secure manner, hides the complexity of setting up various network connections, avoids congestions and costly use of communication links, and supports sharing of data such that only those who are authorized can access or influence information in sensors/actors/machines/things.\n\nThe M2M Service Layer specified by oneM2M provides M2M/IoT communications and data sharing functions that are typically needed across a number of industry segments. It is often called a horizontal M2M service layer. This standard may become a key enabler for larger scale M2M/IoT deployments across a number of different industry segments, enabling Qualcomm to develop products that could be sold into various industry segments without the need for vertical-specific product specializations.[/wpex][/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][text-with-icon icon_type="font_icon" icon="icon-envelope-alt" color="Extra-Color-1"]\n<h4>oneM2M</h4>\nAn increasing number of new industry organizations, consortia, alliances, and standards bodies formed in the area of M2M/IoT.

One of the projects we were working at the time on was CMAT, the emergency broadcast message sent to your phone. It can be a weather warning or Amber Alert. It’s something we were working on at the time, though now it’s in everyone’s hands. We were in this conference room with a bunch of executives, when all of a sudden, the alarms went off on all our phones at the same time.[wpex more=".." less=""] We look and it says there is a flood warning for San Diego. We look outside, and it’s sunny. Not a single cloud in the sky. Apparently, on the mountains, there was a lot of rain, but the alert was broadcast across all of San Diego County.

Everyone in the room stopped talking and listened to the noise, which sounded like some flow of liquid dropping into a bucket.[wpex more=".." less=""] After people realized that the restrooms were within coverage range of the wireless mic system, the whole room started to laugh very hard.

When I left Singapore, we heard that a 7.0 earthquake had hit Japan. I thought, “I’m glad that I left now.” My flight from Singapore back home had a connection through Tokyo. We were on the approach to the runway when the tsunami hit. We had to pull up fast. We circled for about an hour and a half. The captain said it[wpex more="..." less=""] was total chaos on the ground in the tower. They eventually diverted us to Nagoya, but since United didn’t have a hub there, they left us on the tarmac for six more hours. While the captain was waiting for further instructions, I pulled out my laptop which had an EV-DO card in it to find out what was going on. The captain saw the pictures that I was pulling up and he said, “That’s it! We are getting fuel and flying to Inchon, Korea.” So, we did. We landed in at midnight. We ate all the food except for pretzels and water on the trip from Singapore, so everyone was hungry. When we got to the hotel in Korea, they had chefs and staff cooking for us so that we could eat dinner at 1 a.m. We flew home the next afternoon.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\n<h4>Don’t worry, he’s happy</h4>\nWhen you work in standards, you occasionally meet famous people on flights or in hotels.  I once flew on the same flight with Justice Antonin Scalia of the US Supreme Court.  But most memorable for me was an encounter with Bobby McFerrin, the musician, and the author of a hit song “Don’t Worry, Be Happy”. Just about everybody knows that song. Not everybody knows what Bobby McFerrin looks like. Neither did I really, I was not so much familiar with his look as I was with his[wpex more="..." less=""] opus. I knew, for example, that he uses his own body as a percussion instrument, for example by tapping his fingers on his chest.  That was the main clue for me to recognize him in the elevator of a Philadelphia hotel. I turned and asked him: “Are you Bobby McFerrin?” to which he replied affirmatively. We then chatted briefly and I learned that he was going to perform in a concert that evening. I decided to attend the concert, where, it turned out, Bobby was directing a version of Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess,” not performing pop songs that made him famous. I still enjoyed the performance very much.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\n<h4>When we had to run out the clock</h4>\nDuring the Standards War to get CDMA to prevail in the ITU, that’s the International Telecommunications Union, OK, we had two week-long meetings to develop 3G. You’d get the weekends off, but it was really a long thing. And, the bad guys were really killing us. It was war every day and we were using every trick in the book. They wanted us to do some things that, if we had done it their way, it would have been really bad. I remember, so, basically, they wanted us to give in[wpex more="..." less=""] to what they wanted, and they promised that at the next meeting, they would give in to what we wanted, but no guarantee. So, I called Irwin [Jacobs]. And I said, “This is what these guys want to do.” He said, “Well, there’s no guarantee. And once, they have what they want, they may never give us what we want. So, you can’t give in. You must fight them until Friday, when the meeting ends.” So, our allies and I worked together, and when the opposition came to us with a proposition, we would say, “We’re going to go away and have a private meeting ourselves and talk about, and we’ll let you know. We’ll call back to the States and we’ll see if our management agrees to this.” We knew, because Irwin told us not to do it, that we would never give in. So we went to our little back room, ostensibly, to consider the proposition that was offered at that time. The proposition was getting better and better as the week went on, but what we did was, we just played cards. Our management had said, “We can’t give in. If we give in, then we’ll lose because they’ll never give us what we want at our next meeting.” They would have won and CDMA would’ve lost.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_gallery type="nectarslider_style" interval="3" layout="3" gallery_style="1" onclick="link_no" custom_links_target="_self" images="193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200" img_size="603x603"][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_gallery type="nectarslider_style" interval="3" layout="3" gallery_style="1" onclick="link_no" custom_links_target="_self" images="222,223,224,225,226,227,221" img_size="603x603"][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner class="nonattributed"][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\n<h3>You know you are a standards person when</h3>\n[/vc_column_text][testimonial_slider autorotate="8000"][testimonial title="Testimonial" id="1426875499-1-23" quote="You have a large bag of unusable coins from countries around the world.``\n\n``You need to be awake to attend a standards meeting at 3 a.m., but be back at the office, at work at 9 a.m. and function for your remaining nonstandard work responsibilities.``\n\n``You know the best and worst seats on every airplane type flown by three or more airlines." name=" "] Click the edit button to add your testimonial.

The initial solution in 3GPP 5 years ago supported voice calls (VoLTE) and is deployed in our products and in networks all over the world by numerous operators. Support of additional media (text, video, IM) was added by 3GPP around 3 years ago and should be deployed by US operators and supported in our products over the next few years. 3GPP is now studying VoWLAN access at the behest of many US and EU operators, and QSIO is a leading contributor. In addition, QSIO is active in IETF, with regional SDOs in the EU (EENA, ETSI) and China (CCSA, TIAA) [wpex more="..." less=""] and with vehicle telematics providers (Onstar, Verizon Telematics) to enable Next Generation IMS-based E911 solutions to evolve and support a panoply of emergency related services including eCall, mHealth, personal emergency calls, human language negotiation, all using a common IMS solution in carriers. Such a wide variety of services should enhance the attraction and competitiveness of Qualcomm products in all world regions.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Locating emergency callers indoors - multi SDO Work and Study Items</h3>\r\nQSIO is active in several SDOs and in partnership with carriers and other vendors to create and enhance wireless standards to locate emergency callers indoors with unprecedented accuracy. We played a major role in creating agreement between the industry, public safety and the FCC on feasible targets for location accuracy that include a horizontal accuracy of 50 meters and an ability to provide an exact street address including floor level, and in some cases room or apartment identity.[wpex more=".." less=""] We are a leading participant in 3GPP in defining and evaluating indoor positioning solutions that will meet the FCC targets, including OTDOA, WiFi, Bluetooth and barometric pressure. We are also leading in ATIS in creating new North America specific standards that will meet the FCC mandated targets for indoor location accuracy over the next 8 years. Most of the solutions being pursued by us and the industry are already partly supported in our products and play to Qualcomm’s strengths in the area of accurate and reliable location.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>In-Location Alliance (ILA)</h3>\r\nQSIO was a founding member of the In-Location Alliance (ILA) and has been pivotal in helping transform ILA into a global standards related organization now comprising around 70 members whose objective is to create an architecture and set of associated standards to support accurate location of mobile devices inside buildings, venues and other indoor structures. While ILA does not itself write standards, it serves as a focal point for helping other standards bodies (e.g., OMA, IEEE, BT SIG) create applicable standards and has created its own architectural model that a venue owner or operator can use to support indoor location.[wpex more=".." less=""] This model and the associated standards follow Qualcomm preferences and were largely introduced by us. At the moment, ILA is more useful to Qualcomm as a PR tool for our proprietary location solutions. Standards work in ILA has slowed due to uncertainties within the industry as to how accurate indoor location should best evolve. However, if standards solutions regain prominence (e.g., as a consequence of the FCC mandate on indoor E911 location), we and ILA will be in a position to quickly roll out a standard solution.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="center center" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="light" text_align="left" top_padding="8%" id="spectrumengineering" parallax_bg="true" bottom_padding="3%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Spectrum Engineering</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="3%" bottom_padding="5%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]In the quest to solve the 1000x mobile data challenge, spectrum is an important building block. Given that spectrum is a finite resource, the industry is hard at work to utilize the available spectrum in the most efficient manner and to identify opportunities to open more spectrum for mobile data. To achieve these goals in support of Qualcomm’s business strategies, the Spectrum Engineering team performs technical analysis and attends relevant regional/international regulatory groups and SDOs to present the result of our studies and to defend Qualcomm’s positions. We target both licensed spectrum for exclusive use by mobile systems such as LTE and future 5th Generation and unlicensed spectrum for shared used by wireless systems such as WiFi and LTE-U. In addition, we work to unlock government spectrum, which is partially occupied, based on Licensed Shared Access for shared licensed use by mobile systems. Our team closely works with relevant QSIO/QCT/GA teams for a tight inter-company coordination.\r\n<h3>New spectrum resources for mobile broadband IMT/LTE</h3>\r\nWe are active in global efforts to identify and open new spectrum for mobile broadband. An essential requirement in these efforts is to assist global harmonization of candidate bands in the interest of Qualcomm’s business.\r\n<h3>China</h3>\r\n[wpex more="" less=""]We worked in several regions jointly with other companies on opening the band 3400-3600 MHz for IMT/LTE. Our current aim is to open this band in China by participating in the CCSA coexistence studies between IMT and the incumbent Fixed Satellite Systems (FSS). Since 2008, we have actively participated in the CCSA studies on band plan for 450-4570 MHz. We assist the Chinese government in coexistence studies between IMT and incumbent services (railway trunking system, broadcast system, radio location) in co-channel and adjacent bands deployment scenarios and promote the globally harmonized IMT FDD allocation as the band plan for China. We also work on 3300-3400 MHz, 4400-4500 MHz and 4800-4890 MHz bands, which are new spectrum supported by China for IMT.\r\n\r\n[/wpex]\r\n<h3>Japan</h3>\r\n[wpex more="" less=""]Japan’s focus is to open the IMT band for Mobile Satellite Systems (MSS), Downlink: 2170 - 2200 MHz/Uplink: 1980 - 2010 MHz, for terrestrial use. Qualcomm proposed a terrestrial/satellite hybrid system in response to the MIC’s call for proposals in 2013. Softbank Mobile adopted xHRPD (the satellite component in Qualcomm’s hybrid system proposal) as their proposed system and started to work with MIC to acquire this spectrum. We aim to work with Softbank to open the band for terrestrial use.[/wpex]\r\n<h3>Europe</h3>\r\n[wpex more="" less=""]In Europe, we led the technical work in CEPT/ITU-R Joint Task Group (JTG) on Agenda Item 1.2 of WRC 2015 for clearing the UHF 700 MHz TV band for IMT/LTE operation. This defines limits for out-of-band (OOB) emissions caused by LTE UE transmitters in this band to the Digital TV devices receiving below the band. The limits meet QCT requirements and allow a single device implementation based on 3GPP LTE Band 28 for operation in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.[/wpex]\r\n<h3>Promotion of Licensed Shared Access (LSA) concept</h3>\r\nWe are actively involved in Qualcomm’s effort to promote LSA concept as a means for opening additional globally harmonized licensed spectrum for mobile data. Based on our initiative, the Japanese MIC included LSA in its Spectrum Strategy Report as one of technologies for spectrum sharing in the middle term. In China, we contributed to the CCSA LSA work and are currently involved in the CCSA efforts to publish a white paper on LSA. In cooperation with Qualcomm’s standardization and GA teams in Europe, we were successful in opening the 2.3 GHz in several CEPT countries for LTE operation on an LSA basis.\r\n<h3>Spectrum for 5G</h3>\r\nWe started work on spectrum for the 5<sup>th</sup> Generation (5G) of mobile communications systems by participating in the regulatory groups of different regions and also in the spectrum project of NGMN with a goal of more and better global harmonized spectrum.\r\n\r\nIn China, CCSA has launched 5G studies addressing requirements, candidate technologies, and spectrum needs. CCSA will act as external interface for the China IMT-2020 Promotion Group (PG) to international (e.g., ITU-R/3GPP) and regional (e.g., CJK/EU) SDOs.\r\n<h3>New spectrum in 5 GHz band for Wireless Access Systems (WAS) including WLANs</h3>\r\nWe are active in global efforts on 5 GHz band expansion for WAS including WLANs to promote Qualcomm''s strategy respecting Wi-Fi, LTE-LAA, and DSRC businesses. In Japan, our suggestions were accepted at a Technical Study Group of MIC that is investigating new spectrum for WLAN in 5 GHz. We are involved in similar efforts in the US, Europe, and China. In collaboration with NTIA, Cisco, Intel, and Broadcom, our Spectrum Engineering team developed a software tool to analyze WLANs coexistence with radars for providing contributions to ITU-R, the US-JTG, and CEPT groups CPG PTD and SE24.\r\n<h3>Regulations for 60 GHz (IEEE 802.11ad)</h3>\r\nWe are working on new regulations for 60 GHz in Japan. As of April 2015, the conducted output power is limited to 10 mW, much lower than the limit allowed in other countries. This puts considerable restrictions on the IEEE 802.11ad operation in Japan. MIC created a committee to discuss new 60 GHz regulations for Japan. Qualcomm gained support for much higher power for devices in 60 GHz. It was agreed to increase the conducted output power to 250 mW (10 dBi or more antenna gain is required when more than 10 mW is used). The discussions on the Rx spurious emission limits are ongoing.\r\n<h3>Sub-GHz unlicensed spectrum for 80.11ah</h3>\r\nWe are leading studies in Europe and China on technical conditions for the operation of 801.11ah in the sub-GHz band. In Europe, we created at CEPT ECC a Work Item for studies on coexistence between 802.11ah based Wideband Short Range Devices (SRDs) and other SRDs in the band 870-876 MHz/915-921 MHz. We are driving these studies and targeting the finalization of work in mid-2015.\r\n\r\nSince 2013, we have studied with China 801.11ah spectrum needs and proposed 900 MHz as the target spectrum according to analysis of Chinese spectrum allocation and global 11ah spectrum status. We are performing spectrum predictions to justify the need for 5 MHz spectrum for 802.11ah in 920-925 MHz and are performing coexistence studies to address interference concerns of incumbents.\r\n<h3>Spectrum for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)/V2X (Vehicle to Vehicle/Infrastructure)</h3>\r\nSince 2015, we have started seeking some dedicated spectrum for V2X safety application in China. We have joined the work on spectrum demand prediction, as well as the coexistence studies between 802.11p / LTE based V2X technology and incumbent services in the targeted bands and adjacent bands.\r\n<h3>3GPP back-office technical work</h3>\r\nWe support Qualcomm’s 3GPP RAN4 team by performing interference analysis and coexistence studies between 3GPP systems deployments in adjacent bands and between such systems and other services in adjacent bands.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="center center" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="light" text_align="left" top_padding="8%" id="regionalupdate" parallax_bg="true" bottom_padding="3%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Regional Update</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="5%" bottom_padding="5%"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>China</h3>\r\n<h4>LTE</h4>\r\nThe LTE TDD network rapidly deployed after the Chinese government formally issued LTE TDD licenses to all three operators in December 2013. By the end of 2014, CMCC had deployed nationwide 700K LTE TDD eNB, and domestic 4G subscribers reached 80 million. CT and CU were granted FDD licenses in February 2015, one year after an FDD/TDD hybrid network trial, and rolled out LTE service in more than 50 cities. Qualcomm is driving a multi-SIM, multimode solution and standardization to support the explosively growing LTE smartphone market despite fierce competition.\r\n<h4>5G</h4>\r\nChina’s 2015 focus switched from academic research to industry promotion. Led by the National High-Tech Project[wpex more="..." less=""] (863-5G project), China aims to play a more influential role in 5G, with academia and industry researching 5G candidate technologies and system architecture. Qualcomm is establishing a 5G leadership position by participating in all related 5G activities in the FuTURE Forum and CCSA, and giving keynote speeches in the most influential 5G summits.\r\n<h4>Spectrum</h4>\r\nChinese regulators are responding to the industry’s demand for spectrum. Qualcomm is taking advantage of the opportunity to influence China spectrum planning and seeking more global harmonized spectrum for IMT and other new services that Qualcomm is promoting, such as WPT, V2X and 802.11ah.\r\n<h4>Automotive</h4>\r\nTelematics and ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) have received widespread attention in China. Several industry alliances were established by the government and industries to pursue urgently needed standardization and solutions from various perspectives such as V2V, V2I, emergency and maintenance service, etc. Qualcomm is coordinating the efforts in CCSA, TIAA, and C-ITS to achieve a unified solution acceptable for all interested ministries and virtual industries.\r\n<h4>Internet of Things (IoT)</h4>\r\nIn the IoT realm, Smart homes, e-Health/m-Health, and Industry 4.0 attract interest. Qualcomm is actively involved in eUICC and smart wearables standardization, 11ah and oneM2M Rel.1 transpositions in CCSA, and promoting AllJoyn.\r\n<h4>Wireless charging</h4>\r\nChina Regulator, Government Research and Test Forces, and pioneer handset vendors show increasing interest in wireless charging technologies. However many of them are more familiar with the first-generation technology from WPC. QSIO made multiple introductions and promotions of A4WP and its technical work to CCSA and CATR. Qualcomm is also driving WPT spectrum study in China to ensure the best legality of using 6.78 MHz for A4WP/WiPower™.\r\n<h4>Standards reform</h4>\r\nThe Chinese central government is driving standards reform, with an aim to diminish recommended industry standards and encourage consortia to develop standards based on market needs and technical progress. Standards development gradually move to industry alliance and associations, which will give Qualcomm more flexibility and opportunities to bring advanced technologies and products into the China market.\r\n\r\n[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Korea</h3>\r\n<h4>5G</h4>\r\nKorean OEMs and operators are interested in 5G deployment. The 5G Forum and Korean industry are focused on the mmWave channel model, 5G evaluation methodology, and 5G system architecture. The government will have a trial service in PyeongChang in 2018. Leveraging a strong technology position will help Qualcomm negotiate 5G licensing with OEMs.\r\n<h4>Wireless Power Transmission (WPT)</h4>\r\nQSIO is leading WPT in Korea. CJK, WPT, and ITU-R WP1A organized a new group to evaluate the value of WPT technologies. To harmonize operating frequency, it will be helpful for OEMs to get Qualcomm solutions, such as A4WP and Halo™. Samsung announced S6 will adopt the (non-Qualcomm) Qi (WPC) solution, but LGE is interested in A4WP.\r\n\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Japan</h3>\r\n<h4>2020 Tokyo Olympic Games</h4>\r\nThe current buzz in Japan is about the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is promoting various types of new advanced wireless technologies and revising the spectrum policies with an eye towards 2020. Future plans for 5G promotion/trial and other upcoming technologies are being undertaken.\r\n<h4>Fifth Generation Mobile Communications Promotion Forum</h4>\r\nThe Fifth Generation Mobile Communications Promotion Forum (5GMF) was established in September 2014 by telecom companies, academic experts, ARIB, TTC, and MIC. 5GMF promotes research and development of 5G and[wpex more="..." less=""] foresees international collaborations. Qualcomm covers all 5GMF committees. MIC is working on technology rules and spectrum policies on advanced LTE technologies, 5 GHz technologies, and 60 GHz technologies. Qualcomm is a member of those WGs.\r\n<h4>WPT</h4>\r\nJapan’s WPT spectrum harmonization strategy is mostly aligned with WiPower and Halo. Qualcomm is a member of MIC WPT-WG. Qualcomm leads the Japanese delegates at ITU-R WP 1A and APT.\r\n\r\n[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>India</h3>\r\nCreation of TSDSI, India’s SDO, initiated technical coordination among organizations with business interests in India. TSDSI created a group on 5G standardization, focusing on requirement collection. Delegates to TSDSI established Qualcomm as a technology leader and are participating in its activities.\r\n<h4>4G</h4>\r\nBy the end of 2015, pan-India 4G networks will have rolled out. This is likely to bring deployment challenges, especially around Band 40. The India BD team is also looking to diversify on topics outside of our traditional modem space.\r\n<h4>Spectrum</h4>\r\nDoT concluded its spectrum auction. Bands in 800, 900, 1800, and 1900 were up for auction, and MNOs aggressively[wpex more="..." less="."] participated in the process This paves way to improve Qualcomm’s business in the 3G and 4G evolution space.\r\n<h4>White space</h4>\r\nQualcomm is participating in white space-related discussions in India.\r\n<h4> Future growth</h4>\r\nIndia is promoting the Made in India initiative to enhance local manufacturing.

To ensure fair coexistence, both the 3GPP standards team and the WLAN standards team are actively involved in industry activities around coexistence mechanisms, simulations, and tests.\r\n\r\nQualcomm has demonstrated the LTE-U/Wi-Fi fair coexistence at many global events such as the International Consumer Electronics Show (2014) and Mobile World Congress (2014 and 2015).[/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="light" text_align="left" top_padding="13%" bottom_padding="13%" id="internetofeverything" bg_image="58" parallax_bg="true"][vc_column][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Internet of Everything</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="60" bottom_padding="80"][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][text-with-icon icon_type="font_icon" icon="icon-cog" color="Extra-Color-1"]\r\n<h4>Mobile broadband module solutions</h4>\r\nQualcomm cellular chipsets enable an ecosystem of mobile broadband module solutions for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Everything (IoE) applications. The QSIO M2M (Machine-to-Machine Communication)/IoT (Internet of Things) standardization project focuses on interconnecting smart grids, smart cities, smart houses, connected consumer electronics, lights, appliances, vehicles, wearables, and other devices to each other and to the cloud while keeping communications resource-efficient[wpex more="..." less="."] and allowing for very simple usage of network connectivity by application or product developers. Standards for integration of the different technology domains must be specified to facilitate development, deployment, interworking, and interchangeability of equipment.\r\n\r\nM2M and IoT markets are projected to require deployment of up to tens of billions of connected devices. A significant part of that device population is expected to use wireless technologies that Qualcomm traditionally supports in its products. The success of Qualcomm in developing product features that make those products the best choice when developing M2M/IoT devices and services may become a huge market opportunity for Qualcomm.[/wpex][/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][text-with-icon icon_type="font_icon" icon="icon-envelope-alt" color="Extra-Color-1"]\r\n<h4>Relationship with AllSeen Alliance</h4>\r\nThe AllSeen Alliance, part of the Linux Foundation, manages the collaborative open source project, AllJoyn, which is comprised of over 140 participating companies. AllJoyn uses a peer-to-peer technology that enables advertisement, discovery, and usage of services on IoE devices in a proximal network such as a LAN at home. One of the main benefits of using AllJoyn is the simplicity of getting new devices and/or services onboard and make them interact with each other automatically with very little used intervention, using a common language[wpex more="..." less="."]\r\n\r\nThis year QSIO will focus on the interworking of the technology specified in oneM2M with the technology we promote in the AllSeen Alliance. Qualcomm together with other companies are specifying details on AllSeen/oneM2M interworking in the next round of standards produced by oneM2M. While the oneM2M Service Layer focuses more on a hierarchical overlay network with policy-driven communication and cloud storage components, the interworking of the two technologies offers a large potential of synergies. Use cases include: Cloud-based GUI for homeowners via a web browser; automated maintenance notifications for refrigerators, air conditioners, boilers, and furnaces; selectively sharing information: Security sensors with security company and heating control, power consumption with the utility company, etc.[/wpex][/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][text-with-icon icon_type="font_icon" icon="icon-cog" color="Extra-Color-1"]\r\n<h4>M2M Service Layer Specifications</h4>\r\nQSIO achieved a major milestone with the completion of a first release of specifications for M2M communications based on an M2M Service Layer produced within oneM2M, a global partnership of SDOs and industry organizations around M2M/IoT. The purpose of oneM2M is to develop technical specifications that address the need for a M2M communication and data sharing platform for the cloud. This platform is called the M2M Service Layer and can be readily embedded within various hardware and software and relied upon to connect the large number of devices in the field with M2M application servers worldwide[wpex more="..." less="."]\r\n\r\nA critical objective of oneM2M is to attract and actively involve organizations from M2M-related business domains including telematics and intelligent transportation, healthcare, utilities, industrial automation, and smart homes. The M2M Service Layer is typically implemented as software that runs on a wide variety of things in the IoE like temperature sensors, door locks, TVs, air-conditioners, cars, smart homes, routers, and up to large computers in the cloud.\r\n\r\nThis software is like an operating system specially made for sensors/actors/machines/things that need to talk to each other. This software controls when it is OK to use communication networks to send or receive data, connects sensors/actors and the cloud in a secure manner, hides the complexity of setting up various network connections, avoids congestions and costly use of communication links, and supports sharing of data such that only those who are authorized can access or influence information in sensors/actors/machines/things.\r\n\r\nThe M2M Service Layer specified by oneM2M provides M2M/IoT communications and data sharing functions that are typically needed across a number of industry segments. It is often called a horizontal M2M service layer. This standard may become a key enabler for larger scale M2M/IoT deployments across a number of different industry segments, enabling Qualcomm to develop products that could be sold into various industry segments without the need for vertical-specific product specializations.[/wpex][/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][text-with-icon icon_type="font_icon" icon="icon-envelope-alt" color="Extra-Color-1"]\r\n<h4>oneM2M</h4>\r\nAn increasing number of new industry organizations, consortia, alliances, and standards bodies formed in the area of M2M/IoT. In the area of proximity networks and/or smart homes: in addition to AllSeen there is HomeKit (Apple), Thread (Google), and the Open Interconnect Consortium (Intel and Samsung). A key objective is to avoid fragmentation by driving consolidation and partitioning scopes of different groups to avoid overlap. oneM2M itself is a result of consolidating efforts on M2M/IoT communication in seven major telecommunication standards bodies around the globe[wpex more="..." less="."] Today oneM2M has more than 200 members working towards a second release of specifications while first announcements on commercial deployment of the technology have been made.\r\n\r\nQSIO is promoting the value and uptake of oneM2M technology and the synergies of interworking with AllJoyn. We are working with QCT’s embedded Connectivity Engine team (ECnE) on a prototype based on an existing ECnE demo that will support some standardized oneM2M features. We demonstrated this with Sierra Wireless and other partners at a oneM2M showcase event in December 2014. Another demo opportunity is anticipated in June 2015 at the TIA Network of the Future event. QSIO also educates stakeholders internal and external to Qualcomm about the benefits of using this M2M Service Layer for M2M and IoT use cases.\r\n\r\nThese efforts help Qualcomm position its products as the best choice for implementers for the M2M/IoT markets and increase Qualcomm’s market share.[/wpex][/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="13%" bottom_padding="13%" id="automotivestandards" bg_image="302" parallax_bg="true"][vc_column][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Automotive Standards</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="60" bottom_padding="80"][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/3"][text-with-icon icon_type="font_icon" icon="icon-music" color="Extra-Color-3"]\r\n<h4>Automotive standards</h4>\r\nAs a key technology supplier for connected car programs of world-leading automakers for over a decade, Qualcomm is helping automotive manufacturers offer safer, more engaging, connected in-car experiences. Cars can figuratively become smartphones on[wpex more="..." less=""] wheels: interoperable, processor-laden and innately savvy. Ever-increasing processing power enables more effective Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Automotive applications can be best accomplished with standardized communication links and in-vehicle interfaces to address needs of drivers.

The telematics track provides infotainment:  Navigation, real-time traffic information, and entertainment. It can be done with virtually[wpex more="..." less=""] or physically tethered smartphones or via devices embedded within cars.\r\n\r\nThe safety track supports interoperable real-time vehicle-to-X communication, where X could be another car, the traffic signal, or even a smartphone in the hand of a pedestrian. In the future, standardized communications and processing will enable autonomous cars, with even more vehicle-to-X communication, to include more mature ADAS applications and standardized data such as real-time, high-definition maps.[/wpex][/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/3"][text-with-icon icon_type="font_icon" icon="icon-wrench" color="Extra-Color-3"]\r\n<h4>Vehicle to vehicle communication</h4>\r\nThe SAE Dedicated Short Range Technical Committee is charged with transforming the existing vehicle-to-vehicle data exchange messaging to meet the anticipated performance requirements being developed by the automotive and government regulatory[wpex more="..." less=""] communities in order for the government to issue a Notice of Public Rulemaking – and perhaps mandate this vehicle-to-vehicle communication.\r\n\r\nThe endpoint, in maybe one scant year, is clear and rewarding: Definition of the message sets, applications, and performance that give Qualcomm critical use cases to better design our communications and processor solutions that will save lives and pave the way to driverless cars.\r\n\r\nIn parallel tracks, ETSI is developing standards, not for a mandate but for compelling, interoperable safety and mobility applications, and 3GPP has embarked on standards that also address vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The evidence is clear: Our vehicles will indeed talk to and listen to one another and the infrastructure through standardized communication links and data exchange, enabling Qualcomm to offer unprecedented levels of safety and convenience through our products.[/wpex][/text-with-icon][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="light" text_align="left" top_padding="13%" bottom_padding="13%" id="industryawards" bg_image="82" parallax_bg="true"][vc_column][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Industry Awards and Recognition</h2>\r\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="full_width_background" bg_position="left top" bg_repeat="no-repeat" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" top_padding="60" bottom_padding="80"][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/3"][team_member image_url="182" team_memeber_style="meta_overlaid" link_element="none" color="Accent-Color" name="Durga Malladi &amp; Ed Tidemann" job_position="Qualcomm''s IP Excellence"][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/3"][team_member image_url="181" team_memeber_style="meta_overlaid" link_element="none" color="Accent-Color" name="Dino Flore" job_position="Chair of 3GPP RAN TSG-RAN Plenary"][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/3"][team_member image_url="184" team_memeber_style="meta_overlaid" link_element="none" color="Accent-Color" name="Assaf Shacham" job_position="JEDEC Technical Recognition Award"][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3>Industry Awards</h3>\r\n<strong>3GPP Excellence Award - Lena Chaponniere </strong>received this award for LTE D2D / Proximity Services (ProSe) work in the CT working groups (02/05/2015)\r\n\r\n<strong>3GPP Excellence Award – Rich Hovey </strong>received this award for 3GPP SA 1 on Proximity Services (ProSe) (05/15/2014)\r\n\r\n<strong>Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC)</strong> FCC group evaluating security and reliability of telecommunications and emergency services (e.g. E911) - <strong>Bruce Wilson</strong> received special recognition\r\n\r\n<strong>Consumer Electronics Show</strong> <strong>Finalist for Overall Best in Show</strong> - <strong>Kamil A.

When I left Singapore, we heard that a 7.0 earthquake had hit Japan. I thought, “I’m glad that I left now.” My flight from Singapore back home had a connection through Tokyo. We were on the approach to the runway when the tsunami hit. We had to pull up fast. We circled for about an hour and a half. The captain said it[wpex more="..." less=""] was total chaos on the ground in the tower. They eventually diverted us to Nagoya, but since United didn’t have a hub there, they left us on the tarmac for six more hours. While the captain was waiting for further instructions, I pulled out my laptop which had an EV-DO card in it to find out what was going on. The captain saw the pictures that I was pulling up and he said, “That’s it! We are getting fuel and flying to Inchon, Korea.” So, we did. We landed in at midnight. We ate all the food except for pretzels and water on the trip from Singapore, so everyone was hungry. When we got to the hotel in Korea, they had chefs and staff cooking for us so that we could eat dinner at 1 a.m. We flew home the next afternoon.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h4>Don’t worry, he’s happy</h4>\r\nWhen you work in standards, you occasionally meet famous people on flights or in hotels.  I once flew on the same flight with Justice Antonin Scalia of the US Supreme Court.  But most memorable for me was an encounter with Bobby McFerrin, the musician, and the author of a hit song “Don’t Worry, Be Happy”. Just about everybody knows that song. Not everybody knows what Bobby McFerrin looks like. Neither did I really, I was not so much familiar with his look as I was with his[wpex more="..." less=""] opus. I knew, for example, that he uses his own body as a percussion instrument, for example by tapping his fingers on his chest.  That was the main clue for me to recognize him in the elevator of a Philadelphia hotel. I turned and asked him: “Are you Bobby McFerrin?” to which he replied affirmatively. We then chatted briefly and I learned that he was going to perform in a concert that evening. I decided to attend the concert, where, it turned out, Bobby was directing a version of Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess,” not performing pop songs that made him famous. I still enjoyed the performance very much.[/wpex][/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h4>When we had to run out the clock</h4>\r\nDuring the Standards War to get CDMA to prevail in the ITU, that’s the International Telecommunications Union, OK, we had two week-long meetings to develop 3G. You’d get the weekends off, but it was really a long thing. And, the bad guys were really killing us. It was war every day and we were using every trick in the book. They wanted us to do some things that, if we had done it their way, it would have been really bad. I remember, so, basically, they wanted us to give in[wpex more="..." less=""] to what they wanted, and they promised that at the next meeting, they would give in to what we wanted, but no guarantee. So, I called Irwin [Jacobs]. And I said, “This is what these guys want to do.” He said, “Well, there’s no guarantee. And once, they have what they want, they may never give us what we want. So, you can’t give in. You must fight them until Friday, when the meeting ends.” So, our allies and I worked together, and when the opposition came to us with a proposition, we would say, “We’re going to go away and have a private meeting ourselves and talk about, and we’ll let you know. We’ll call back to the States and we’ll see if our management agrees to this.” We knew, because Irwin told us not to do it, that we would never give in. So we went to our little back room, ostensibly, to consider the proposition that was offered at that time. The proposition was getting better and better as the week went on, but what we did was, we just played cards. Our management had said, “We can’t give in.
